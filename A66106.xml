            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Chriſtian Reader,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IF the skill in handling of it had any way anſwered the excellency and utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubject handled in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermons, there would have needed no Apology for the publication of them. The Parable under conſideration comprizeth (in most lively and heart-affecting alluſions) many pretious truths. Here are divers My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Providence cleared, pointing to thoſe ſecret wayes wherein God carries his Decree of Election under ground a great while, before it riſe and break out in effectual Calling: here we learn how far a choſen one may run from God before he turns: here we are instructed in the methods God uſeth to bring wanderers home, and recover the moſt profligate Sinners by Repentance: the nature of true Repentance is here curiouſly limned, and the tranſactions between God and a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his Converſion pathetically deſcribed:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108954:3"/> yea, how miſerable a thing it is to be a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how happy to be a Saint is wonderfully illuſtrated. The fountain of Grace is here opened, and the deep ſtreams in which it runs revealed: and all this accommodated to the moſt feeling apprehenſions of the ſoul. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have but drawn a veil upon the picture, and am deeply ſenſible of my own inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to Diſplay theſe Myſteries: all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I can give of the publiſhing this imperfect thing, is, knowing it the deſire and duty of thoſe that fear God, as they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to do all the good they may in their places; &amp; God having ſo far afforded his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing with theſe Sermons in the Preaching, that many Souls have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the benefit received by them, ſome of whom have deſired they might have the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage of their being made publick; I was therefore induced for this reaſon to conſent to it; hoping withal (if God ſees meet) that it may be further beneficial to ſome or other, to ſhew them to themſelves, and inſtruct them in the way of life: to give light alſo to, and help ſome to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own ſtate: only let it be (for
<pb facs="tcp:108954:3"/> caution) adverted, that I have not here undertaken to confine the Spirit of God in his wayes and methods with his Elect, in bringing them home; but only have ſignified that ſomething of all that is herein expreſſed is one way or other done in the Soul that is ſavingly brought over to Chriſt. The work of Converſion begins to be thought a ſmall thing; and a matter of little obſervation or wonderment for a Sinner to become a Saint: Many Commence Believers before they were either convinced or humbled; and that is the reaſon why ſo many prove Apostates: The great deſign of the Parable, and aim of this Diſcourſe upon it, is that proud and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sinners may be awakened and humbled, and brought off from their empty and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſes; and that abaſed and ſelf-loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Sinners may be encouraged, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their profuſe and prodigal wayes, to return to God in Chriſt for his mercy, and ſo may tast of the Royal Feaſt, and be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at that noble Table, which God hath prepared for them who come home from their far Countrey, by true Repentance. My en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is, that out of the mouth of

               <p>THe Riches and Freeneſs of the Grace of God, manifeſting it ſelf in the Converſion and Salvation of undone ſelf-ruined Sinners (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the ſame Grace firſt provided for this in the glorious Redemption wrought out by Chriſt) is one of the great deſigns of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel diſcoveries. Proud nature ſlights it it ſelf,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108954:5"/> and envies it to others. The ſelf-conceited <hi>Phariſee</hi> deems none to deſerve favour but himſelf, and thinks he hath reaſon to find fault with a merciful God, if he reveal and apply his mercy to any other. A notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this, the Chapter afore us doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: our Saviour Chriſt is recorded, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. (and it was not the firſt time that he had ſo done) to condeſcend to teach Publicans and Sinners in the great concerns of their Souls, and inſtruct them in the way to eternal life: <hi>[Ver.</hi> 2.] The <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> (thoſe ſelf-admiring Juſticiaries) take great offence, and when the almoſt did they otherwiſe than find fault with the ſpotleſs actions of Chriſt? but when offence is taken and not given, the woe denounced falls upon thoſe that take it: Chriſt therefore doth not for this abſtain, leſt they ſhould be prejudiced, but ſtrenuouſly maintains and juſtifies that which he hath done againſt all their cavils. The main things which we aim at in this vindication are the diſcovering:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Subjects of Gods Grace are not <hi>Phariſees</hi> but <hi>Publicans,</hi> not men righteous in their own vain Opinion, but ſuch as are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners both in their own and others account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God is the firſt in this great work, he ſeeks up loſt ſinners before they ſeek after him:</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the greateſt diſtance which ſinners
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108954:5"/> have ſet themſelves at from God, can neither hinder their return, when he comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, nor give obſtruction to his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and kind acceptance of them returning. This our Saviour Chriſt illuſtrates in three Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables; the two former more brief and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, and (being taken, the one from a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, the other from an inanimate thing) not ſo full; the third more ample and large, as carrying in it a very great Analogy to the thing; which laſt is the ſubject of the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In order to the entrance upon this Subject, give me leave to premiſe a few words touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and uſe of Parables in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Parables are properly <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> or <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi> compariſons, wherein, under the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of other perſons, actions or things, ſome other like thing is intended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our conſideration. The word Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is variouſly uſed in Scripture, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19. it is uſed for an exchange, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. for a pattern: but in the Goſpel uſually for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of heavenly truths under earthly ſimilitudes: The Scripture maketh mention of two ends of the uſing of Parables, which indeed ſeem to be contrary, which contrariety chiefly ariſeth from the different way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108954:6"/>1. They are to wrap up myſterious Truths in obſcurity: they are a kind of Riddles which require great Study to enode them. Chriſt to this end ſpake them to the multitude, of the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 10, 11. it was not given to them to underſtand the myſteries of the Kingdom; they were to break their teeth upon the ſhell, and not come at the kernel: Hence they are called dark ſayings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 6. and this is this their nature, when there is only the propoſition, or parable it ſelf propoſed, without its illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are to explicate and clear up a Truth to the underſtanding by the help of the ſenſes. They ſpeak of ſenſible things, ſuch as are obvious to our eyes, ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo lead us to a conception of ſpiritual things; and this is done when the Reddition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them is given: ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 18. When a Parable is opened, it bringeth more light to mens underſtandings, then plain enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of Truth, and adds to be very uſeful for the moving of the affections.</p>
               <p>Now if we would make a genuine improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parables, we muſt carefully attend unto theſe two Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Parables are not ſo much for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation as for Illuſtration, or the opening of our underſtandings to the conception of things: we do not ſo much argue by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108954:6"/> (though there be ſomething of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in it too if it be pertinently framed) as clear up the matter we are upon to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of thoſe to whom we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we muſt not ſtrain the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Parables beyond the purpoſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the ſimilitude, but reſt in the main ſcope of them: for, becauſe they are Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, that which we have to mind is the thing which they are improved to ſhadow out unto us. The neglect of this Rule runs men into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors: we muſt carry this as a certain truth, <hi>That ſuch things as are condemned by plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture prohibitions, are in vain ſought to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Parables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to the Parable it ſelf: Let it not be thought vain or needleſs that Chriſt uſeth ſo many Words, and divers Parables to inſinuate the truth of Gods free Grace; but let it inform us of our ſtupidity, &amp; Chriſts rich condeſcendency to us, ſo as to take ſo great pains to inſtruct us in the matters of our Souls welfare.</p>
               <p>The main ſcope of this Parable is to ſet forth the rich Grace of God to miſerable ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undone ſinners, and the great pleaſure which he takes in their Converſion: it therefore preſents us with the pattern of a grieyous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and diſcovers to us, both what he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108954:7"/> Converſion, and how he is converted, and what welcom he finds with God upon his return unto him: this is that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended, unto which there is added a diſcovery of the malice of carnal Profeſſors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſincere Converts: all of which is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out to us, under the compariſon of a Father and his two Sons, and the carriage of each of them. This Parable, amongſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Writers, bears the title of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, becauſe ſuch an one is the primary, and principally intended Subject of the Diſcourſe. The Parable may be divided into four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal parts, beſides the introduction to them, in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. viz. 1. The Prodigals goings away from his Father, with the conſequences of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, to 17. 2. His return to his Father, with the motive and manner of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, to 20: 3. The entertainment which he finds with his Father at his returning, <hi>ver:</hi> 20, to 25: 4. The carriage and deportment of his Elder Brother, with the circumſtances depending, <hi>ver:</hi> 25 to the end: I ſhall endeavour (as God ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt) to ſpeak to each of theſe ſeverally and in order.</p>
               <p>The Introduction you have in <hi>ver:</hi> 11: in which we have the perſons and relations uſed in the Parable intimated, <hi>viz: A Father and his two Sons:</hi> Interpreters variouſly aſſign the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or meaning of theſe perſons: That God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108954:7"/> himſelf is here repreſented under the title of a Father, is without any juſt reaſon of being doubted; for although ſpiritual Adoption is not here aimed at, (nor, poſſibly, is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to the viſible and external relation of men to the viſible Church, which is a ſort of outward Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4.) yet herein our Saviour intends to expreſs the carriage of God towards men, by that of a Father to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and it is certain that God is in the Scripture, with reſpect to his Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, called <hi>the Father of all Fleſh.</hi> Some by the two Sons underſtand the <hi>Jews</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the Younger: but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloſe with their judgment, who refer the Parable to the preſent caſe and queſtion: Doubtleſs Chriſts deſign here is to lay matter of conviction before theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf from their injurious aſperſions, of having undue commerce with Publicans and Sinners. By the Elder. Son then is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> thoſe ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that made a ſhew of zeal and rigid auſterity in legal performances, and ſo counted themſelves the deſerving Heirs and Inheritors of the promiſes: and by the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is intended <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be excluded from a right to this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, men that were ſelf-condemned, and could pretend to no ſuch hopes. It is not my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108954:8"/> purpoſe or buſineſs to inſiſt on theſe things only let us by the way obſerve, That there is many a Man calls God Father, who is yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a prophane ſinner, or at leaſt an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Profeſſor. The challenging of ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo built, will ſtand men in little ſtead. If we will call God Father Profitably, let us carry our ſelves as becomes his Children: let not men boaſt of their Priviledges, and for that count themſelves Elder Brethren, knowing that there may come thoſe from the Eaſt and Weſt, the North and South, that ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and with <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God, when the Children of the Kingdom are ſhut out: and on the other hand, it may encourage convicted ſenſible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to come humbly to God, and to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in hope; for thoſe that ſo do are in the moſt likely way to find him a Father to them.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to the parts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe 12. And the younger of them ſaid to his Father, Father give me the portion of Goods that falleth to me, and he divided unto them his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part deſcribeth to us the Prodigal's going away from his Father, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108954:8"/> and events. We muſt not ſeek for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries in every word: the general ſcope of it is to ſhew us how far ſin leadeth us from God, how many provocations it hath in it, and to what miſeries and ſtraits it reduceth us: and this is ſet forth by the pattern of a fooliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Son, dealing moſt unworthily by a kind and indulgent Father; meriting by his carriage to be rejected, and bringing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all miſerable exigencies by his ſo doing. Of this part of the Parable we may briefly take this partition; it conſiſts of two parts, or holds out to us:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The folly of the younger Son.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The miſery which enſued upon it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. His unreaſonable demand of Ins portion, to have it in his own hand and diſpoſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His improvident and waſtful misimprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His unreaſonable demand; this is the firſt thing we have to take notice of in the twelfth verſe: in which deſcription we may obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The perſon making this demand: the <hi>Younger Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The perſon of whom he makes this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>his Father: He ſaid to his Father, Father:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The demand it ſelf, <hi>Give me the Portion of Goods that falleth to me.</hi>

               <p>1. Touching the perſon that makes this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he is called the younger Son; whether the Opinion of ſome will hold, that would have him called the younger, to note his folly and childiſhneſs, I cannot well ſee; though it be a proverbial ſpeech in ſome Nations, to call a giddy ſhallow witted perſon a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet that it was ſo uſed among the Jews, I find not: the ſcope of it may rather ſeem to be, that our Saviour would here (to make way for the illuſtration of Grace) repreſent this Son at all diſadvantages, whereof this is one. If a Father had no Son but one, he might have greater ſeeming reaſon to bear more with him, and paſs by many and great offences, as having no other to confer his love upon; and if he have more than one, the elder Son might promiſe himſelf moſt of his Fathers patience and connivance, as looked upon under greater advantages, and often carrying away the beſt portion, not of Goods only, but of Affections alſo: but for a younger Son thus to abuſe his Father, this aggravates his fault; and for him after this to find favour, and obtain acceptance when there was an elder Brother, this enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the kindneſs: and may teach us thus much;</p>

                  <p n="2">2. His asking is under the notion or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of an intereſt in it, he calls it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Portion falling to him:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108954:13"/> the juſtice of it, as will be ſeen in the next <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And truly nature it ſelf teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this leſſon, and the providence of God in the arbitrary and unaccountable diſpoſal of theſe things, evidently affirms it; ſo that a man muſt firſt blot out the remains of the Law of nature, and put out the eyes of his experience before he can deny it. It is God who gives to men all their natural faculties, and the power of them, he makes not only the eye, but the ſeeing eye: Mens underſtandings and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wits and wills, parts and diſpoſitions, and all the benefits and bleſſings that in this world they are accomodated withal, are the proper fruits of God's bounty to the Children of men. They are God's gifts in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have their Original from his power and goodneſs: <hi>God formed the eye, he planted the ear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 9: God was under no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural obligation to the creature, he owed him not ſo much as his being, nor any either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or external ornament of it; he ſtood no more engaged to give Wiſdom to the wiſeman, than he did to the fool: <hi>Nabal</hi> had as much right, and as good a claim to counſel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding as <hi>Achitophel,</hi> &amp;c. Whatever men have they had it of him, and it was his bounty that beſtowed it; it is he that gives life, breath, and being to all; and he gives it as he will:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108954:14"/> He gives men their <hi>Songs in the night, i. e.</hi> their conveniences and comforts, and he <hi>teacheth them more than the beaſts of the field,</hi> though they practically forget, or do not regard whence all this comes, as <hi>Elihu</hi> complains, <hi>Job</hi> 35. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are preſerved and upheld in being by him: It is he alone who maintains that which he had before conferred upon us: <hi>He keeps our ſoul in life, eye from tears, foot from ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Pſal.</hi> 116. 8. He is called the <hi>preſerver of men, Job</hi> 7. 20. Mens wits, abilities, powers, comforts and delights laſt no longer than he ſees meet to maintain them, it is his hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath that keeps them up from ſinking, and when he plucks it away, they dy and periſh, nor can they draw breath one moment longer than his ſuſteining providence ſupports them, <hi>Pſal. 104. 29. Thou hideſt thy face, they are troubled, thou takeſt away their breath, they dy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The power of improving or making uſe of any of them is from him: Obſervable is that paſſage of the wiſemans, <hi>Pro. 20. 12. The hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ear, and the ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> Both the faculty and operation wholly depends upon him; we not only live but move alſo in him: If he at any time ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his concourſe, that very ſuſpenſe gives ſufficient check to our operations, <hi>Pro. 16. 1. The preparations of the heart, and the anſwer of the tongue is from the Lord.</hi> A man may have a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108954:14"/> great eſtate, but without him a man hath no power to make uſe of, or take any comfort in it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6. 2:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God is by no natural neceſſity bound to give or continue theſe favours to the Children of men: Whatſoever he doth upon this ſcore is meer bounty; though men may call it <hi>the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods that belongeth to them,</hi> and ſeem to challenge it as due debt, yet God might, had he ſo ſeen meet, have given it all away from them, and done them no wrong: He cannot owe the creature any thing, except he volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily become a debtor by free promiſe, which puts upon the thing promiſed the proper quality of a gift.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And he either withholds or taketh them away according to his Sovereign pleaſure; yea, and beſtows them too in what degree he ſees meet, without being accountable unto us: Hence proceeds the various diſtribution of theſe gifts and favours of God: One is born a natural, another with excellent endowments; one is rich, powerful, highly honoured, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poor, ignoble and deſpiſed; yea, and the ſame men are now up and then down; <hi>Job</hi> in the morning the moſt opulent and flouriſhing of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> at night, poor to a Proverb: Yea, and we can give no reaſon of the diſtribution, wicked <hi>Dives</hi> is rich, and abounds in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights; honeſt <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is a beggar and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108954:15"/> full of ſores; and if a reaſon of all this be demanded, <hi>Solomon</hi> will give us the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 11. yea, and our Saviour Chriſt in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. This affords us a wholſome cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, that none of us pride our ſelves in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward, natural or moral endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; theſe are not things to be gloried in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. Remember you purchaſed them not to your ſelves, you have nothing but what you received: Are you tempted to deſpiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Reflect and think who it is that hath made you to differ: Have you excellent wits and parts? Remember that it was of God that you and the verieſt fools did not exchange places: Have you wealth? Had God ſeen meet, this might have been the beggars portion, and his yours; <hi>God made both;</hi> it's <hi>Solomon's</hi> note: <hi>Pro.</hi> 22. 2. And if once you come to pride your ſelves in theſe things, God can blaſt them in a moment, and put a diſgrace upon your glory: <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. Here ſee what great reaſon there is why we ſhould improve all that we have and are to the glory of God: as alſo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin that miſuſe them to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Be we then exhorted to beware to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what improvement we make of them. It was a convincing reproof which God gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 8, 9. She did not know that I</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:108954:15"/> 
                     <hi>gave her Corn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will therefore return and take away my Corn,</hi> &amp;c. God claims all the common gifts which you have received, as his; he ſaith it is my corn, my flax, he counts your knowledge, your good natural diſpoſitions, your wealth, your power, to be his, and expects that you uſe them for him; and if you ſhall do otherwiſe, he will let you know of it, and it will be a ſad reckoning that he will call you unto. God's <hi>goodneſs leads men to Repentance, Rom.</hi> 2. 4. And withal know that God deſigns his own Glory by whatever he doth and if you do not ſo do too in your improvment of all, he will in a judicial way recover it at your hands, and get himſelf a great name upon you: God will not be a loſer by any of his Creatures: Let this humble and awaken ſuch as have a more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral portion than others, conſidering that <hi>where much is given, much is expected.</hi>

                  <head>DOCT. II. <hi>Sinful man counts all thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and acquired favours which God beſtowes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, to be his own, and would have them at his own diſpoſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>There are two aſſertions contained in this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He reckons upon them to be his own: the Son claims a Portion as due to him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch a right thereto as by the rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108954:16"/> he may challenge, and though upon Sovereignty he may withhold it, yet he deems it injuſtice if he deny him: Thus, whatſoever God is pleaſed to do for ſinful men, they are ſo far from acknowledging his immerited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence therein, that they account it a debt. I know there is ſomething <hi>Connexively</hi> or <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically</hi> belongs to the Creature, but ſtill the whole depends upon God's good pleaſure. If God will have ſuch a Creature, ſerve to ſuch an end, there muſt be a capacity and ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs put in to it unto this ſervice and end, elſe it can never reach it, but all this is only <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> for God properly ows to the creature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its being nor its end: &amp; yet vain man thinks he holds all <hi>in capite,</hi> that he is a natural and rightful heir to all the Wit, Wiſdom, Wealth, &amp;c. that he hath. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnazzar,</hi> boaſts of his <hi>Babylon, he made it, and for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Dan.</hi> 4. 30. and thus they, <hi>Pſal. 12. 4. Our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> Reaſon <hi>for this</hi> there is none, for if men knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or would eye the work of Creation and Providence, they would find full conviction of their low &amp; depending eſtate, and deep obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto God for diſtinguiſhing undeſerved favours: But the Reaſon <hi>of it</hi> is from the pride which is in the heart of man, and hath been there ever ſince he aſpired to be as God, whence he doth not willingly acknowledge any ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108954:16"/> or dependence; and is ſo farr from owning of that condition which Creation pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in, <hi>viz.</hi> of a ſubordinate depending Creature, that he counts himſelf a Lord, and beholden to none, much leſs then will he yeild the merit of that miſerable ſtate which ſin hath reduced him unto, in which all the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Covenant-right, whatever it was which before the fatal Apoſtacy he had, is forfeited. And that men do thus account of theſe things appears in this one invincible Demonſtration: <hi>viz.</hi> That as they do not thank God for theſe things, ſo neither do they aim higher than at themſelves in the improvement of them. Have natural men Wit, Wealth, &amp;c. they ſeek their own glory and not God's: Thus did <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. 21. Hence they aſcribe all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Hab. 1. 16. They ſacrifice to their net, and burn incenſe to their drag.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE.</hi> To convince and reprove this folly in the Children of men: Are theſe things your own? how came you by them? what did they coſt you? whence had you to pay for them? did you put them into, or procure them for your ſelves? who was it that taught you more than the beaſts of the field, you your ſelves, or God? what did that little piece of common Maſs or matter merit of God to be made into a man, and not a bruit? have you any thing which God did not beſtow upon you? and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108954:17"/> what obligation had you laid upon him to do it? wherein ſtood he more engaged to you than to others? can you keep them as long as you pleaſe? or can you entaile them upon your poſterity? nay, can you ſay they ſhall be yours the next houre? if you can do none of all this, why then do you boaſt and pride your ſelves in theſe things? be aſſured if you are grown too proud to confeſs them to be God's it's the ready way not to have them long yours: If <hi>Nebuchadnazzar</hi> will not give God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of making him a man, he can ſoon let him know how eaſily he can change him into a beaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He would fain have all theſe favours at his own diſpoſe: He is not content unleſs he may have them in his own hands; like a child, who, when he begins to grow up to years, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently grows weary of Family Government, and cannot bear to be limited or controlled in any thing by his Parents, but muſt have his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate given him, and ſet up for himſelf: This truth is evident by the lives of men; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are not content to be reſtrained and directed by the Laws of God, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of theſe gifts; the bounds of the precepts are too narrow for them, they muſt walk at large; tell them of the Command, they regard it not, and their lives ſay as they did with their tongues, <hi>Jer. 44. 16. As for the word which</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:108954:17"/> 
                     <hi>thou hast ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord we will not hearken unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men do not manage themſelves in the uſe of theſe things to the advancement of the honour and glory of God in the world: They do not ſerve God with their gifts, and eſtates, but ſerve divers luſts; they make panders of them for their corruptions: Great Wits are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually looſe and licentious, great Eſtates are mens ſecurity to ſin againſt God with the more boldneſs: It is a rare thing to ſee men that have the greateſt viſible advantages for it, to be very zealous for God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the rebellion of the nature of fallen man: Man in his Apoſtaſie ſhook off the yoke of obedience, and cannot endure to take it on him again: <hi>Ephraim</hi> profeſſeth himſelf as an untamed heifer, that, not being accoſtumed to, knew not how to ſtoop under the yoke, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. Man is therefore ſaid to be <hi>born as the wild Aſs-colt, Job</hi> 11. 12. which never keeps in the incloſures, but hath the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his range: Mans heart is become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and filled with a principle of enmity againſt, which makes him hate ſubjection to the law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the miſtaken opinion which he hath taken up of liberty. Liberty is, if tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, a moſt deſireable good, and a great part of a Believers happineſs, but the heart of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108954:18"/> ſinful man hath fooliſhly put that glorious title upon the worſt of licentiouſneſs, and hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he accounts himſelf to be under intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſtraint, ſo long as he may not take his ſwindge in the world: and hence he eſteems the law to be no better than a priſon, which is indeed a <hi>perfect law of liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 3. For Mans fond apprehenſion of of his own wiſdom, <hi>Job 11. 12. Vain man would be wiſe.</hi> Every natural man is fondly opinionated of his own diſcretion, though he is indeed a meer fool and Child, yet he thinks he knows better than his Lord and Maſter: Gods Laws are not ſuted with mens carnal principles; they apprehend they ſee a great deal of weakneſs in them, and needleſs hazards in obeying of them; they are impolitick, and they can preſcribe to themſelves a better way to attain their ends than that which God hath laid out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. We ſee here the reaſon why men of large parts and abilities uſe them ſo little to the glory of God, the moſt part of ſuch men improve their wit to invent ſin, and find out vain, carnal, and fleſhly devices, and worldly ſtratagems to advance their own by-ends: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſe their eſtates to feed and humour their luſts, to pamper their pride, voluptuouſneſs, or covetous humors: the reaſon of all this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man being turned away from God, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108954:18"/> fallen upon other objects, is not willing to be ruled by God: Had men been free to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like Children, and kept their own place, God would have taught them to have better improved his gift. By this therefore you may diſcover a natural man, he is like a young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that is broken away from Family Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with his reins on his neck, and lives like one that hath none to rule him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. To admoniſh us that we beware of giving way to this inclination: Our nature is prone to it, and we have therefore reaſon to be the more watchful againſt it: and there are two things which if well weighed, will be helpful here:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we cannot of our ſelves order any thing well, <hi>Jer. 10. 13. I know that the way of man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to direct his ſteps.</hi> Man ever, when left to himſelf, proves himſelf but a fool; he is like a poor young Child, who, if he be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watched by his vigilant Parents, will run himſelf into every miſchief that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That except God guide and rule us, we ſhall but provoke him, and, the more he lends us of his favours, the more exorbitances we ſhall run into, and thereby make our account the greater and more dreadful; let every one then receive this conviction, and be there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108954:19"/> awakened to go to God and ſubmit to him, entreating him to take us under his watch, care and rule; then only are we ſafe when he undertakes to manage us by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly counſel.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the affairs of the world are ordered &amp; diſpoſed of by Divine Providence.</hi> Whatſoever any of the Children of men have or enjoy, it is of God. The univerſal extent of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God to all affairs, and things in the world, is a principle whereof there is no liberty for any man to make a queſtion, the denial whereof, even in the ſound judgment of Meer <hi>Ethnicks</hi> was branded with the deſerved note of Atheiſm: and the confirmation of this truth is fully eſtabliſted in Scripture, aſſigning to all Creatures an abſolute dependence upon the diſpoſal hereof: See <hi>Pſal. 145. 15, 16. The</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108954:20"/> 
                     <hi>eyes all wait upon thee &amp;c.</hi> and in many other places.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That in the courſe of this Providence many wicked men enjoy all favours in abundance.</hi> This is ſo notorious a truth, that the ſo frequent, and almoſt conſtant obſervation of it, hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dazled the weak eyes of the People of God, and put them to a demurre in their thoughts. In <hi>Job's</hi> time it was not a thing ſo obſcure as his friends would have made of it; hence <hi>Job.</hi> in his own vindication amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>Job</hi> 21. begin. <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph,</hi> gives no leſs a pathetical deſcription of it, and his own imbecillity in thoſe offenſes which he had taken at the obſervation of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. begin, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo ſeems to be in ſome ſuſpenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 1. What power, honour, and and dominion had <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> conferred upon him? What an oracle of Wit and Policy for his time was <hi>Achitophel?</hi> What eloquent curious language had <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Tertullus;</hi> yea, and we may ſtill obſerve men to be fulleſt fraught with theſe common favours, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorifie God, nor have any deſire to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him therewithal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That theſe men are left of God to uſe theſe, or rather abuſe them, at their ſinful pleaſure,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in thoſe divers wayes wherein he ſo leaves them. For though it is true that God doth reſtrain wicked men unto ſuch limits as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108954:20"/> he ſees meet even ſuch as ſhall make all ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Glory at laſt, yet they are in very high meaſures given up by God; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they do abuſe them is manifeſt, by the evil improvment which they make of them: Obſerve but what courſe men of greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages do uſually ſteer in this world; doth not all drive at the advancing of the intereſt of Satans Kingdom, and not of Chriſts? And how few great men improve their power for his Glory? the moſt do it for his diſhonour; hear the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 16. Not many wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after the fleſh, not many mighty, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe carnal things for the moſt part ſerve but to ſtrengthen the enmity of the heart againſt God; poor, weak, and baſe things are they which for the moſt part follow Chriſt:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods leaving them thus to do diſcovers it ſelf in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His withholding his ſpirit, and not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them his renewing or aſſiſting Grace, without which no man can improve any thing to the Glory of God. When God doth not give a man an heart to be for him, he thereby leaves him to himſelf, and it is a Judgment; <hi>Moſes</hi> bewails it, <hi>Deut. 29. 4. The Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive,</hi> &amp;c. And there needs no more but this ſuſpenſion, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon which is for men to go in the wayes of their own heart, and ſight of their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108954:21"/> eyes: When God intends that a People ſhall go in his wayes, he promiſeth them his Spirit, <hi>Ezek. 36. 27- I will put my ſpirit into you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> The ſpirit of God is the inward guide of the Children of God, they that are deſerted by him, are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given up to their own guidance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His laying no outward check or reſtrain upon them to hinder them, or ſtop their courſe. When God would no longer leave <hi>Iſrael</hi> to himſelf, <hi>he hedgeth up his way with thornes,</hi> that he ſhall not find the way to come at his luſts and lovers, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2: 6, 7: But where he lets men have a large range, liberty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when he afflicts them not, but they proſper and have all at will, and there is no outward controle, this is a leaving men: thus God did to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 7. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His turning of theſe favours into ſnare and provocations of their luſts, to allure and draw them after them: There are many luſts in the heart of man and theſe outward mercies are ſutable matter for them to wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> upon: and when God lets it be ſo; yea, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially orders it to be ſo; when he gives them their table to be a ſnare, their wealth a ſnare their health and ſtrength a ſnare, their wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108954:21"/> by theſe things, then God gives men up to their own hearts luſt, and lets them walk on in their own wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 12. He puts their Portion into their own hand, and lets them go whither they will, and do what they pleaſe with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To anſwer ſome doubts which may here ariſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether this doth not caſt imputation upon Gods Holineſs, in giving men his favours, and leaving them to themſelves, when he knows they will both abuſe them, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him by their ſo doing; whereas his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs engageth him to ſeek his own Glory in all his works of Providence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That God will be no loſer of his Glory by any of his Creatures, in any of his works which he doth to or for them, is a truth not to be queſtioned; but the wayes in which he will be a ſaver, and no loſer, are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the management of his own infinite wiſdom, which doubtleſs will not fail in the execution, and though he may for a while ſeem to be on the loſing hand, whiles men are running on the ſcore with him, and meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of payment; yet if we can let God alone till his day and time of reckoning with men, he will then make it to appear that he will be glorified in all the <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> and wicked men of this world, whom he hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108954:22"/> up, and ſuffered at preſent to abuſe his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mercies to their own ruine; and were it not that God knows how to get his penny worths out of them, he would never credit them ſo far as he doth: God will be glorified in <hi>Zidon,</hi> as well as in <hi>Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But God ſeems by this to be an encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wickedneſs, and promoter of mans vile deſigns: Is not this to put a Sword in a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hand, that he may deſtroy himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal? And if God hateth ſin, why would he thus give men advantage to ſin againſt him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The wisdom of God in ordering of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things according to his own counſels, is not for us mortals to call in queſtion: God hath other Attributes beſides his Juſtice to make known, and they are his bounty, patience, goodneſs, long ſufferance; and this he can do upon the veſſels of wrath, and thereby makes way for the glorious manifeſtation of his Juſtice upon them that are not led to repentance by it, but abuſe his goodneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Neither doth God by this encourage ſin, ſince by his holy Law (which is man's rule, and a diſcovery of his righteous Judgment) he ſtrictly forbids, and ſeverely denounceth threatnings againſt all ſin: Neither is God's bounty the moral cauſe of promoting of ſin, but hath argument in it to prompt men to holineſs and obedience;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108954:22"/> but it is man's corrupt heart abuſing it to ſuch ends; whereas an holy heart is encouraged by all God's benefits to ſtudy his Glory and praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. And yet God may righteouſly leave man to follow his own wicked heart, and ſo to misimprove all his beneficence to his own juſt condemnation; yea, he may raiſe up <hi>Pharaoh to that very end, Exod.</hi> 9. 16. But I come to the Reaſons of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which will ſerve further to clear the truth from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and they are taken from the ends which God deſign in thus doing; which though they are at preſent ſecret in regard of the individual perſons who are thus left, till God of his Providence ſhall be pleaſed to make more full and clear diſcovery of them, yet in themſelves they are alwayes one of theſe two, for all Gods dealings with mankind do ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately center in the one or the other <hi>viz.</hi> either.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thus way may be made for the more illuſtrious manifeſtation of revenging Juſtice, in the deſtruction of ſinners: They are thus made <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Where much is given, there is much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: The more that men have abuſed, the more wrath awaits them: Doubtleſs a man of great parts and underſtanding, hath more to account with God for than a fool, the rich and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, then the poor, a Magiſtrate, or a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108954:23"/> Miniſter, then a private Man: The more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Men have put into their hands to ſerve God withal, the more they have to anſwer for, you may ſee what endictments God draws up againſt <hi>Babylon, Iſa. 14. Tyrus, Ezek:</hi> 27. which had the advantage of other Nations, of worldly pomp and wiſdom: For ſuch God hath wonderful plagues: This patience, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they are largely diſplayed before ſuch at the preſent, ſo they, by mens abuſing of them, open a way for the more notable executions of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he may prepare a way to make his Grace notably appear to be Grace, the truth is, Gods wayes are very myſterious, and paſt mans finding out; and oftentimes, when we may have reaſon juſtly to fear, that ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is mounted on Horſe-back, to run the ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his own utter ruine, yet even then God hath gracious deſigns in all this: God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times allows a ſinner a long Tedder, and lets him run to the end of it, and then pulls him back: God ſuffers him to lay a ſcene for his own ruine, and then diſplayes his riches of his grace in ſaving him from it, when he hath uſed all poſſible means utterly to have undone himſelf: <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> in the old, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> ſtand for eminent examples of this, and the latter of theſe ſpeaks thus of it, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13, 14. Who was before a blaſphemer.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. To teach us not too much to bleſs our ſelves in our enjoyment of outward favours. God's love is not from hence to be poſitively concluded: It is the wiſe mans ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. begin. <hi>No man knows love or hatred by all that is before him.</hi> And yet there is nothing more common than for men to be be proud and ſelf conceited in theſe things whereas they are indeed nothing elſe but ſome of the offals of God's favours, which he can ſpare to the ſwine of the world, and often throws out to them in a plentiful meaſure: Things common to the Elect and Reprobate are not juſt matter of boaſting; if you have all theſe bleſſings, and are wicked in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, you are not happy but miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that enjoyment.</p>

It may alſo teach us not to grudge at, or envy wicked men, for their great parts, and large eſtates, or whatever other worldly bleſſings they enjoy in a more liberal meaſure than other men: and the more we ought to beware of this, inaſmuch as good men have ſometimes been prone to be envious at theſe things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. begin. Yea, the Prophet had a mind to have impleaded God about it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1. If God leave them to themſelves they will but abuſe and fooliſhly ſquander them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108954:24"/> and then you know, the more Talents any have received, the more are to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and if he fared ſo ill that did but hide his one in a napkin, what account ſhall he be called to, that ſquanders many away upon his luſt, and diſhonours God with them? It would have been better for ſuch men if they had been the veryeſt fools, and the moſt obſcure perſons in the world: And as you have leſs of theſe things, ſo you have the leſs to reckon for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this will not hinder your happineſs in the end, but if you have the grace to be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in a little,</hi> you ſhall ſurely <hi>enter into your Lords joy.</hi>

                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. It may afford encouragement not to deſpare of unregenerate men, although they may at preſent be left to themſelves, and wickedly to abuſe all God's favours which they enjoy: God knows how to take them in their months: The poor Prodigal, left to himſelf, went far, but yet he returns at laſt, and is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly welcomed by his Father: If men are bad at preſent, it doth not hence neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they ſhall never be good: Hence be not put out of heart, do not think your prayers and tears are thrown away, which are laid out for their converſion; yea, but be the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, by how much you ſee that they may be more ſerviceable to the glory of God than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; how much their rich parts, abilities,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108954:24"/> advantages would bring into the Treaſury of the Temple, if God ſhould be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 4. It may counſel us all to beware how we deſire to be at our own will and diſpoſe; to be left to our ſelves, to have our own portion in our own hand: God may grant ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſires, but if he do, we ſhall ſmart for it: Know therefore that every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> left to himſelf, will prove a Prodigal: If we are not willing to be under the direction of Gods Law, and conduct of his ſpirit, he may righteouſly leave us, and then we ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do as this yonger Son did, which is the next thing we are to enquire into.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And not many dayes after, the yonger Son gathered all together, and took his journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Country, and there waſted his ſubſtance with riotous living.</hi>

                  <p>In which words is deſcribed to us the ſecond point of his folly, appearing in his improvident and waſtful miſſimprovment of his Portion; and this diſcovers it ſelf in two things. 1.

                  <p n="2">2. There are many luſts in the heart of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unregenerate man to which he is enſlaved man, by ſeeking an unbounded liberty, had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108954:27"/> changed one good Lord, for many tyrannical ones, that have uſurped the Dominion over his ſoul, <hi>Tit. 3. 3. Serving divers luſt and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:</hi> The word intimates one that is addicted unto, or wholly at the devotion of another, and is uſed to expreſs our ſerving of God: Mens luſts rule them, their work and buſineſs is to gratifie them, and it is not one ſingle luſt, but there are many of them, and he is at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them all; each claims an empire over the ſoul, and ſets him on work to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, there is the luſt of the fleſh, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concupiſcence, the luſt of the eye, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, the pride of the life, or ambition, theſe muſt all be obeyed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The luſts of an unregenerate man are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatiable: <hi>Like the horſe-leeches two daughters, or like the barren womb, they never ſay they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> or like the grave, which is ſtill gaping after more, hence ſo compared, <hi>Rom. 3. 13. Their throat is an open Sepulchre.</hi> all concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence labours of a dropſie, the more it hath, the more it craves. When a man hath done his utmoſt to make proviſion for, he can never give content to his carnal deſire, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 20. And there is great reaſon for it, becauſe concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath diverted the heart of man from the only ſoul ſatisfying object, to empty things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The outward favours which God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon men are the proper objects upon
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108954:28"/> which their luſts are placed, &amp; from which they ſeek their ſatisfaction. Every carnal heart hath (with <hi>Demas)</hi> embraced the preſent world: When man left God he went to the Creature, and what God had provided to expreſs his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him in, that hath he abuſed to ſerve his luſt withal: It is the world and the things of the world that his heart is in love with, which is oppoſite to the love of the father, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. God hath in juſt judgment ſet the world in mens hearts, for that they know no other good, nor ſeek any other content; not God himſelfe, but his common favours are their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether natural endowments, or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal bleſſings.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The natural man can ſpare nothing of theſe from his luſts: The truth is, all is too little; every thing is loſt that doth not feed ſome luſt or other: every luſt is like <hi>Nabal,</hi> only generous and noble to it ſelf, but churliſh to <hi>David:</hi> It may be ſaid of every luſt, as was ſaid of great <hi>Alexander. Unus Pellaeo juveni non ſufficit orbis.</hi> Hence then it is no wonder if ſo many luſts think themſelves ſtraitned; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is bound to pleaſe all his luſts, and there is not enough in a whole world to give them content, and then it is not to be thought ſtrange, if he cannot ſpare any thing in the world from them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſerving of God and ſerving a man's
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108954:28"/> luſts are things directly contrary the one to the other; and hence a man cannot do them both. That man who ſeeks his own glory, cannot ſeek the Glory of God; they that mind their own things, cannot mind the things which are of God: And this is the very reaſon why men can allow God nothing of glory at all, becauſe they think they ſhall then wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, diſſatisfie their own luſts: If men ſhould ſincerely improve their wit and parts for God, they ſhould then loſe their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations from men; if they ſhould lay out their health, and ſtrength, and power, and wealth for God, their luſts would want it: and, it being ſo that they are full reſolved in it to deny their concupiſcence nothing, hence they gather all together, and leave nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and reſolve that they will not part with ſo much as an hoof for God and his ſervice.</p>

                     <hi>USE.</hi> 1. Hence we ſee one great reaſon of the vanity of the creature: The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>It is ſubjected not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected it in hope, Rom.</hi> 8. 20. The reaſon of it lyeth here, ſinful man hath gotten it into his hands, God hath providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given him a Portion of theſe things, and he through the vanity of his mind, having it at his own diſpoſe, hath carried it away from God, and diverted it from its native and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe, which was for the ſervice of God, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108954:29"/> his own wicked and ſiniſter ends, by vertue whereof it comes to be in vain. The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath in its ſelf its uſefulneſs, every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God hath a natural capacity of being improved to his glory, man might as well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God with his wit and parts, and ſubſtance as diſhonour him; they are Talents which might be traded withall for him, but a wicked heart having ſeduced him, he turns them into another ſtream, and ſo in application they loſe their end and become vain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. Here alſo ſee the reaſon why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of greateſt abilities and advantages, are many times the moſt averſe from doing any thing to the glory of God: We often ſee it is ſo, and wonder whence it comes ſo to be; we think, oh, what, and how much might ſuch and ſuch a man do for God, if he would but propound it to himſelf as his buſineſs to live to him? but alas, as they have a great portion of Gods bleſſings, ſo they have great luſts to gratifie, and they live at their devotions hereupon, let God call for their ſervice, let their conſciences tell them they wrong their own ſouls. Let the name and intereſt of Chriſt call never ſo much for their aſſiſtance, luſt countermands, ſin that reigns there will not have it to be ſo, and men have taken it up as a practical reſolution, that they will ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God than their luſts.</p>

                     <hi>USE.</hi> 3. Let this ſerve to convince unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men of their great wickedneſs, and ſhew them what a dreadful account they will have to give in to God at the great day: Conſider of it ſolemnly, is it not enough for you to go away from God your ſelves, but muſt you needs carry away the whole creation of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with you? Shall God gratifie your deſires in giving you a large portion of his bounty, and can you not give him one hearty acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for it all, but becauſe he gives you in abundance, do you therefore <hi>ſay to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes? Job</hi> 21. 14. Be convinced of folly and madneſs, and hence conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a moſt ungrateful requital of God; it is a moſt ſhameful abuſe of his goodneſs: he may well expoſtulate with you, as he did with them in, <hi>Deut. 32. 5. Do ye thus requite the Lord, Oh fooliſh people and unwiſe?</hi> Do ye not know that <hi>goodneſs leads unto Repentance? Rom.</hi> 2. 4. And will you reſiſt that leading, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it lead goodneſs into rebellion? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Jeſurun wax fat, but he muſt preſently kick?</hi> out of doubt a merciful God is grievouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſuch things as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do you not know that by thus doing you are laying up treaſures of wrath for your ſelves? And will not your account be fearful and tremendous, when the fuel of that fire in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108954:30"/> which you ſhall burn eternally, ſhall be made of abuſed goodneſs, and your torments ſhall bear proportion to the favours which you have now enjoyed; when the creatures, which are now groaning under the preſſure of violently impoſed vanity, ſhall come in as witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and be earneſt pleaders that the wrong which you have done them may be righted upon you? Be therefore awakened to ſee the vileneſs of your own hearts, bewail your grievous folly, ſeek repentance and pardon, that you may be cleared of this dreadful charge in the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. What it is to go away from God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is an eſſential, and a providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Omnipreſence of God, from which no creature can withdraw it ſelf, for in it <hi>we live, move, and have our being;</hi> this preſence fills heaven, earth and hell; it is the preſervative of all beings, it is the godly man's joy, and the wicked man's priſon. Neither is this going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God a local motion, but a ſpiritual withdrawing. We may therefore obſerve, that beſides the general preſence of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and univerſal Government of the world, by which he is intimately preſent with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and beſides that preſence of ſpecial and powerful Government, by which God leads all reaſonable Creatures to an everlaſting eſtate, and in which he drives wicked men to their end, and gets Glory by them, there is alſo a preſence of ſpecial Grace, often pointed at in Scripture, by which God guids and leads his own people by his Word and Spirit, in all their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108954:31"/> way affording them counſel and ſupport, and guiding them to Glory, inwardly by his ſpirit, outwardly by his Ordinances, and Providences: Now when men refuſe to be under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and withdraw themſelves from it, now it is that they do both ſay unto God depart from us, and do alſo themſelves depart away from God; and this is done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When men do all they can to put God out of their thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. abſence is a great help to forgetfulneſs; But wicked men deſire not to think of God, or his Word, of his promiſes or threatnings: Men live without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.

And they are gone far from God, having, as much as they are able, ſhaken off the thoughts of his being, power, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108954:31"/> the earth.</hi> Men would fain have it to be ſo, and as they would have it, ſo they preſume, and pleaſe themſelves that it is ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men, by falſly interpreting of Gods patience and benignity, do preſume him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and approve of their wicked wayes; ſo they argued, <hi>Pſal. 50. 21.

And what is this but to go far from God, when men make ſuch a God of him, that if he were ſo, he ſhould ceaſe to be God?

                  <p n="4">4. When men go on in evil wayes adding ſin to ſin: all ſin ſets the creature at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the holy God; ſin is of a ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, <hi>Iſa. 59. 2. Your ſins have ſeparated between you and your God.</hi> Every tranſgreſſion is a ſtep from God, when men throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into vain courſes they are upon their journey; and as they grow more bold in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, they get further off from him: Sin is called a going a whoring from God, &amp; what is that but a going from the lawful husband, to the bed of a ſtranger? Apoſtate <hi>Judah</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be <hi>gone far from God,</hi> Jer. 2. 5:</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:108954:32"/>5. When men put away from them the fear of God: this is the character of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal. 36. 1. There is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> This is interpreted a <hi>forſaking of God, Jer. 2. 19.</hi> God dwels in mens hearts by putting his fear into them, when he cauſeth them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his wayes, to love his commands, and to be afraid of his Judgements: but when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, they thruſt away his law, refuſe to hearken to his counſel, and are not awed by his Judgments, their will cannot ſubmit to his, when conſcience is ſtifled, or lulled aſleep, and men ſin ſecurely and without any dread, now they are gone far from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the evidence of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that it is ſo, the Scripture is plain; it is the very chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of wicked men, as we heard, <hi>Pſal. 73. 27 They that are far from thee, ſhall periſh.</hi> And that their proſperity emboldens them to it, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo aſcertains us, <hi>Pſal. 55. 19.

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the natural rebellion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the heart of man againſt God: Men hate God, they abhorre his holineſs, his Laws diſreliſh their carnal aims and ends, croſs and

From the natural tendency there is for the ſinful heart of man to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this rebellion by outward proſperity: When men have their Portion large and great, they hope they can now vye it with God: the Prodigal had no more uſe or need of his father, now he had his Portion, and therefore as long as that laſted he regarded not to come at him: If God ſpeak to back-ſlidden <hi>Judah</hi> in her proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, <hi>She will not hear:</hi> proſperity makes men proud, <hi>Pſal. 73. 5, 6.

                  <p>It is not only a waſt, but a riotous waſt, which is the worſt ſort of unthriftineſs in the world: We may take up the Explication of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in a few Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The common favours of God are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate mens ſubſtance: their wit, their health, their wealth, their priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are their portion, which they have in hand: I mean,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are that which they place their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, the things in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which they hope to get their living; they place their confidence and truſt in them, <hi>Pro. 10. 15. The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City.</hi> They have nothing elſe that their heart relyes upon, they call them their goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they expect to have their whole good from them, they take up their reſt and content under the ſhadow of theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:108954:36"/>2. They are the Talents which God hath ſent them to improve for his Glory, and for their ſouls good: God hath put them in their hands with a command that they ſhould trade them for him, and in his ſervice: The Lord expected that <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſhould have glorified him with his Power, and Kingdom, and great glory which he had advanced him to, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23. He counts that men have by theſe things an advantage in their hands to do him ſervice, that they have a price, and if they are not wiſe in the improvement thereof, for the exaltation of his name, he reckons it for an unexcuſable tranſgreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. begin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ungodly or unregenerate men do ſpend all theſe upon their luſts. This is the nature and guize of every man in whom the fear of God is not, not to honour him, but to ſacrifice them to his fleſhly deſires: What elſe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate <hi>Iſrael</hi> do with God's favours? <hi>Hoſ. 2. 8. For ſhe did not know that I gave her the Corn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which they prepared for Baal.</hi> And the Reaſon of this is, becauſe, as men place their happineſs in ſatisfaction, ſo the natural mans ſatisfaction conſiſts in giving content to the carnal demands of his own mind; if theſe be not ſatisfied he is diſcontent: ſin hath ſo blinded the eyes, &amp; deluded the judgment of fallen man, that, till Grace comes in to inform him better, he knows no bleſſedneſs but in pampering and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108954:37"/> cheriſhing the craving concupiſcence of his ſoul: The rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. placeth his whole happineſs in his ſouls eaſe, and that by giving himſelf full ſcope to <hi>eat, drink, and be merry;</hi> and that is a real deſcription of the frame and opinion of every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> before the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion paſſeth upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For a man thus to do with the favours of God, is to waſt and ſpend his ſubſtance moſt unprofitably. When a man uſeth his wit, wealth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to maintain his pride, his ſenſuality, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him in prophaneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is to play the greateſt ſpend-thrift, for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Man's great buſineſs which he hath in this life to trade for, is happineſs: It is that which every man ought to aim at, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the thing which all the Children of men do propound to themſelves, <hi>Pſal. 4. 6. Many there be that do ſay, who will ſhew us good?</hi> They differ indeed in the way and means (and there are almoſt as many courſes taken to obtain it as there are men that ſeek it) yet all naturally agree in this one end, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may do and be well: and the right improving of ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to this end, is the great thing where in man's wiſdom doth moſt properly conſiſt: If a man miſſeth of happineſs in the end, all the labour that he hath been at here in this world is loſt, this is the very thing which the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108954:37"/> wiſe man ſo often, in the book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> calleth <hi>Vanity,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a mans loſing his propounded end, <hi>viz.</hi> his ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end, <hi>i. e.</hi> Bleſſedneſs: tis only the loſs of this which can prove a man to have lived in vain, and ſpent his time, and coſt, and care unprofitably.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The only way for us to improve the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Gods unto the enjoyment of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is in the ſervice of God. As happineſs is our ſubjective, ſo is the Glory of God our objective end; and God hath tyed theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo inſeparably, that man cannot poſſibly make a ſeparation of them, without his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable loſs: The way to Glory is to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, our glorifying of him is to be expreſt in our improving of his bounty, to us aright, in honouring of him; <hi>thoſe that honour him, he will honour.</hi> There is nothing we can do ſincerely for God, but it redounds to our well-being; parts, power, priviledges, and all other creature enjoyments uſed for God, do help forward our everlaſting ſalvation. Hence</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All is utterly loſt which is laid out upon our luſts: whatſoever men uſe to the ſervice of their own deſires ultimately, it's abuſed, it is waſted in riot, it is groſly thrown away. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is hereby diſhonoured, and ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked againſt us. It is the higheſt affront which we can offer to God to ſerve his enemies
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108954:38"/> with his favours, and hither do all the corrupt inclinations of our hearts lead, ſo much as we allow to them, ſo much we rob God of, we take it from him when we give it to them, and this he will not bear at our hands: it is the great quarrel which God hath with the world of ſinful men, that he is forgotten and diſregarded while they ſeek and ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man's happineſs and everlaſting well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being is no way promoted or furthered by it. A man is never the nearer happineſs by all that he beſtows upon himſelf, <hi>he may bleſs himſelf, and others may bleſs him, Pſal.</hi> 49. 18. But he is not in the way to true bleſſedneſs: He may ſwim in pleaſure boaſt himſelf in his delicacy, and count himſelf an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, but he is not nearer Heaven and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereby he obſtructs and wofully hinders his own ſalvation; in ſtead of helping it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it is the great obſtacle to it; it ſets him further off from true good: When once the <hi>Prodigal</hi> is gotten into his far Country, and is now fallen to waſting his Eſtate in riot, he is in the moſt hopeleſs condition of all. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſetled in any courſe of ſin, is moſt unlikely to return to God, whiles he is gratifying his luſt, and taſteth a great deal of ſweetneſs in his beloved ſin, now he cannot endure ſo much as

                  <p n="1">1. What man is like to come to if once he be ſeparated from Gods gracious preſence. If God leave men, they waſt all: That every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man is not as vile and profligate as ever any was, is of God's reſtraining grace; if he but withdraw, and that man be left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all goes to rack; let God do never ſo much for him, put never ſo fair a price into his hands, he but abuſeth and ſquandereth it all away: It is therefore a dreadful judgment of God for any man to be left to himſelf: See, <hi>Pſal. 81. 12. Rom.</hi> 1. 16. Every diſtance that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108954:39"/> man ſtands at from God, is one ſtep to his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and undoing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That every natural man is a very fool: For what is folly if this be not, for a man to waſt away his ſubſtance unprofitably, to ſpend away profuſely what he ſhould have improved for his eternal benefit and good? How well might this young man have lived if he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his Stock, &amp; improved it in a way of commerce? whereas by living on it, &amp; laying it out laviſh he waſteth all: And what might many men do for their ſouls, had they the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to trade with their Stock in heavens market, and exchange their outward bleſſings for ſpiritual benefits? but herein lyes their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the young man thought his Eſtate would bear him out, thus men outwardly favoured of God, think they may live as they liſt, and <hi>this their way is their folly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That every unregenerate man is in the high road way to miſery. The young man while he lives high upon his Stock, is bringing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace to that bottom, it is waſting. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours of God are of a ſpending nature, and, if laid out upon mens luſts, will quickly be gone, and come to nothing: There is nothing but ſaving grace that will encreaſe by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, every thing elſe wears out and decayes: If you ſee a man giving up the rains to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and pleaſing himſelf in his vain and

The young man may thank himſelf if he hath nothing left him to live upon, his own prodigal waſting brought his Eſtate to ruine. I am far from their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who think that a natural man, by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his beſt gifts, abilities, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, can lay any engagement upon God to give him ſaving grace; but this is certain, that God will charge upon ſinful man every abuſe of any part of his goodneſs, and this ſhall leave him without excuſe: that men ſpend their time, and ſtrength, and eſtates in the ſervice of ſin, ſhal bring them under great condemnationin the laſt day, <hi>Hoſ. 13. 9. Oh</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou haſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſelf.</hi> Though fallen man cannot of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſave himſelf, yet it is his own folly that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeth him: If men had uſed what they had to Gods glory, they might have done well, that they have done otherwiſe is of their own ſinful inclination: If men would yeild themſelves up to the guidance of God's holy ſpirit, they might obtain eternal life; if they will (with the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Son) get away from God, and follow their own corrupt genius, and by ſo doing they undo and ruine themſelves for ever, let them thank their own fooliſhneſs.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108954:40"/> men, and thoſe eſpecially upon whom God hath beſtowed much of his common boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I would plead with ſuch as theſe in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 55. 2. Wherefore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread?</hi> See and be convinced of your deſperate folly and madneſs: God hath given you underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, health, ſtrength, comforts of this life, the Goſpel of grace, and the means of ſpiritual good; why do you ſpend all this in riot, lay out all in that which will do you no good at all? wherefore is all this waſt? but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. See and be convinced that whatſoever you gratifie any ſinful luſt withal, is meer riot; all is loſt that luſt gains: The covetous man boaſts that he is no <hi>Prodigal,</hi> he ſaves, whiles the other ſpends, he layes up whiles the other layes out, and doth not lay out unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; but know it, whiles you are feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your covetous humors, and ſatisfying that eager deſire, and greedineſs of gain, you do but conſume it. The voluptuous man thinks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ill ſpent that may afford his ſenſual part any ſatisfaction, and whereof he may taſte the ſweet: but know it, a life of pleaſure is but death, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 6. She that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> The ambitious man reckons it a glorious purchaſe, if with all his wit, policy, and advantage, he may obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108954:40"/> and eſteem, applauſe and credit among men; but what hath he bought for his mony but ſmoak, and the Eaſt wind? We may ſay the like of every other luſt. There is no purchaſe but that of Salvation, but is dearly bought with the expenſe of our precious time, thoughts and care; all this ſets you further from heaven and glory, and if you could purchaſe the whole world at the hazard, much more than with the ſale and loſs of your ſouls, you would deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure the name of ſhamful unthrifts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seriouſly ponder and conſider with your ſelves what theſe courſes will lead unto: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore that your times and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are given you to trade for eternity withal, whereas that is nothing which you are now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care for leſs than that: Are you not build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rotten fabrick that will tumble down on your heads? Are you not laying a ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which will be waſht away with the flood? and then what will become of all your expenſe? What emolument, what comfort will you get by all? Do not theſe wayes make you forgetful of Eternity? Do they not harden your hearts from the fear of God? and what but miſery will be the fruit of ſuch things? Think what an exchange you are making, what it is you part with, and for what; it's Heavens Glory, the love of God, everlaſting bleſſedneſs which is ſet before you, and all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108954:41"/> things are to encourage you to embrace and make ſure of it; this you part with, this you ſell, this you put away from you for <hi>Eſau</hi>'s meſs of Pottage.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider what is the reaſon of all this, how it comes to paſs that you are in a way to ſuch a loſs; is it not becauſe (with the <hi>Prodigal)</hi> you are gone from God, and gotten into a ſtrange Country? <hi>there be waſted his ſubſtance;</hi> If you had kept with God, you might have done well enough: the very root of man's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is departure from God, thence all his lewd and riotous courſes derive their original: Let it then ſerve to convince you that you are at a diſtance from him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn hence to account your ſelves truly miſerable, ſo long as you remain in this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God; and let it be an awakening conſideration to drive you to be diligent in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and ſerious in returning to him: Know then, that all God's Talents muſt be reckoned for; what you waſt away riotouſly, God will call you to a ſtrict account of it, and wo will be to him in the great day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hath thrown away God's favours upon his own luſts: If the man that hid his Talent in a napkin was ſo ſeverely dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, what then will be done to him that cannot ſay here is thine own, but ſhall be enforced to this confeſſion, I nouriſhed my pride with thy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108954:41"/> favours, I ſought mine own credit by the parts and underſtanding which thou gaveſt to me, I cheriſhed mine own applauſe by the honour and power which thou didſt afford me among men, I fed my luſts with the creature comfort I enjoyed, my viſible priviledges and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip made me ſecure and careleſs of my ſoul, I boaſted my ſelf in my wiſdom, ſtrength riches, Goſpel-favours, and did not ſeek to make my boaſt in God alone; will not this be a ſad and doleful account? What need have we then to be now very ſollicious in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get our account cleared, whiles, in way of true Repentance we may obtain this favour through the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and, whiles we have time and opportunity, to get into a better way of improving our ſelves? Could men but lay out that time, and ſtrength, and heart for God, which they do upon their luſts, that would turn to their account, and that which is now juſtly accounted waſt, would be found to be the beſt thrift: this would be the way to be happy in another world; then ſhould we have a Portion to live on, when the fooliſh worldling hath ſpent his, we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought to want: Beg then of God to grant you this wiſdom, and labour with ſo much the more diligence to redeem the loſs that you have already ſuſtained, who have hitherto been ſpending away ſo much without profit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108954:42"/> that if you waſt and expend all now upon the vanities of this life, and the carnal delights of the preſent time, you will have nothing to live upon in the dayes of eternity, and then your preſent waſtfulneſs, will be (too late) found to have laid that unhappy foundation of your utter and eternal undoing.</p>

               <p>IN the younger Son's departure from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there were two things propoſed as obſervable. 1. His folly. 2. His miſery. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have been conſidering the former of theſe, the words read bring us to the latter. hence</p>
               <p>It follows to conſider of the miſery which

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108954:43"/> and now all was gone. It was a ſad alteration which befel this poor young man, a few dayes ago he was ſwaggering and ſpending with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

That poor man is the blameable cauſe of his own miſery; though it be a plain concluſion from the words, yet, having hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at it before, I paſs it over here. The main thing I would now take notice of in the words is, that his own ſtock failed him, all his portion came to nothing. Hence.</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. <hi>All that which natural or unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men place their confidence in, will fail, and leave them ſhort of Salvation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Let men have never ſo much of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours, without ſaving grace all will come to nothing in the end: Man may make a flouriſhing ſhew with theſe things for a while but they will not laſt: There are things which the Scripture tells us <hi>periſh with the uſing;</hi> ſuch
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108954:43"/> are all the common gifts of God. For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this truth, obſerve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is properly ſaid to be ſpent which is laid out unprofitably. What men lay out for advantage, is not ſpent but improved; but that which brings in nothing again, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expended but miſpended: The Scripture expreſſeth it by labouring for the Eaſt-Wind, by laying out mony, for that which is not bread, by labouring in vain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For a man to give his Gold or Silver, in exchange for Cockles, Pearls for Pebbles, Subſtance for Shadows, this is that which is deſervedly accounted ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nothing is profitably laid out, but what is expended for Salvation: This is the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purchaſe that any of the Children of men can trade for: A part in Chriſt is the only Riches, a Crown of Glory is the only honour, a place in the Paradice of God is the only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is worthy a Man's laying out of coſt and care for; and other purchaſes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, and will be found loſs, <hi>Eccl. 1. 3. What profit hath a man of all the labour which he hath taken under the Sun?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though all mankind are (in ſome ſenſe) trading for Salvation or Happineſs, yet the greateſt number are there trading for it where it is not to be found; they are ſeeking the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the dead; they are ſeeking heaven
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108954:44"/> in hell, happineſs among an heap of miſeries: One man's wealth is his God, anothers pleaſures are his felicity, another climbs the Pinacles of honour to ſeek for the ſeat of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Nature leads men no higher than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the Sun, and therefore ſuch as ſee no higher muſt of neceſſity ſpend their time, their wit, their eſtate, their all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The beſt improvement that nature can make of Gods common favours, cannot bring them to find and enjoy bleſſedneſs: Let men uſe them never ſo frugally, and prudently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſures which they take of prudence, and frugallity, yet they will fall ſhort. Nature could never by its own ſtrength arrive at ſaving grace, nor by the outward help of all the common bleſſings of God: A man may have health, ſtrength, underſtanding, ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, many advantages, but let him make his beſt of them, all will fall ſhort: <hi>It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, Rom.</hi> 9. 16: theſe all are either but nature which is in a man, or but external things which he enjoyeth, and man cannot climb up to Heaven on the rounds of ſuch a Ladder.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence when the natural man hath done his utmoſt, and taken the greateſt pains in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his time, ſtrength and eſtate, he loſeth his ſoul: Nay, it is very certain, that though a man be never ſo proud and confident in thoſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108954:44"/> many bleſſings God which he hath conferred upon him, yet ſooner or later, he ſhall have a through and ſenſible conviction of his poverty; that he hath nothing which is ſaving, that he hath waſted and miſſimproved that which he had to unprofitable miſpenſe <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. Here we ſee what a poor Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unregenerate men have, and therefore what little cauſe have they of pride, or the people of God of envy. God gives his enemies a great deal, but alas, what is it? Poor periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtuff, ſpending, waſting ſubſtance, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed worthy of that name: Think of this you that are proud of your wits, your wealth, your honour, your priviledges; what it is that you pride your ſelves in? or what will you do when all is ſpent? and ſuch is the miſerable <hi>exit</hi> of all that you are boaſting your ſelves of: you now flouriſh and <hi>ſpread your ſelves,</hi> ere it be long all will be gone, and no where to be found, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37, 38. There are thouſands of caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties to which the object of your truſt is daily expoſed, you are ſure of nothing; nay, there needs no more but your ſelves and your own folly to ſpend it: You may for a while carry before you a breadth in the world, and bleſs your ſelves in what you have, but it will not be long ere your mouths ſhall put upon you the name and title of fools, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. Your wit will not direct you to happineſs, your
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108954:45"/> wealth will not purchaſe you honour and glory; if not before, yet certainly in a dying hour they will all leave you, and then your naked ſoul paſſeth into eternity with nothing to live upon for ever: But if God intend your ſouls good, you ſhall, before that time, have your eyes opened to ſee that all this is nothing: your dependence upon theſe things ſhall be broken, and your hopes vaniſh: <hi>Lift not then up the born on high, nor ſpeak with a ſtiff neck.</hi> And you that are the Saints of God, be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; go with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> into the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſee their end, and then ſhall you find all that, which your miſtake hath called happineſs and proſperity, to be nothing better than painted miſery; yea, woful infelicity. Little reaſon hath that man to make his brags, of the love of God, that hath no better an argument to ground his title upon. It had been well for ſome men if their Portion in this world had been leſs, ſome hopes there would then have been, that they would have been perſwaded to have ſought a durable portion in another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. Let it teach us all not to content our ſelves with any thing but ſaving Grace. Be not ſatisfied with no more but a Portion of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward favours; it is a great miſery to think we have enough when we have nothing elſe: Let us not be well pleaſed to ſit down with things that will not laſt or hold out: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108954:45"/> thou art an everlaſting creature, and muſt endure for ever, and what good can a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portion do thee for eternity? Think with your ſelves, what will all theſe things avail me, which will not laſt out thoſe infinite ages in which I muſt have a being, and without a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt needs be miſerable? It is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours advice to think of this when we are about laying up our treaſures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 20, 21. All Gods common gifts and favours are lyable <hi>to the moth and ruſt and thief;</hi> the preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe things is ſo far from being an happineſs, that it will be an aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of our miſery when they are gone, that once we had them, when we ſhal have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left of all, but the ſorrowful rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Learn therefore <hi>Luther</hi>'s reſolute pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Lord, I will not be put off with theſe things.</hi> Remember the worlds wiſe men with their wiſdom go to hell, wicked men will ere long be ſtript naked; let this put you upon it, to ſeek for your ſelves a Portion which endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. For encouragement and comfort to the People of God; I mean ſuch as have gotten a part in ſaving Grace, you may want, or be ſcanted in all outward bleſſings, you may have but a little of worldly wiſdom, a little E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate here, little favour among men, but be not diſcouraged with theſe things; have you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108954:46"/> ſaving Grace? you have the better Portion, and therefore better, becauſe it ſhall never be taken away; this is durable riches; the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſhall periſh, but yours ſhall endure: All the wit, good nature, moral righteouſneſs, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious profeſſion, vain hopes and confidences of ungodly men ſhal all periſh; they live now jovially upon them, but all will ſhortly be ſpent, and then where are they? or what ſhal they do? but your Grace, though little, ſhal not waſt but increaſe, your hope, though languid, ſhal endure; ſaving Grace ſhal never go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; you ſhal live by your faith here in this world in deſpite of all adverſity and temptations, and this faith ſhal never leave you, till having accompanied you in death, and waited upon you to eternity, it hath brought you to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion of the Kingdom of Glory. That man is a rich man indeed, that hath believed in Chriſt; he is rich in poſſeſſion, he ſhal never want; and he is infinitely rich in reverſion, for <hi>Jehovah is his portion,</hi> and all the glories of Heaven are his heritage: bleſs God then for his grace; if wicked men owe God thanks for a ſpending portion, how much more do you owe him of gratitude for that which endures unto eternal life?</p>
                  <p>2. The other cauſe of his miſery, was from the place that he was in; <hi>there aroſe a mighty famine in that land.</hi> Here are three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108954:46"/> obſervable which made his miſery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great. 1.

The meaſure of the famine; <hi>a mighty famine.</hi> The word ſignifies ſtrong, powerful, prevailing: It was far greater than ordinary. 3. The place where it was, <hi>in that land:</hi> which was in a far Country, where he was a ſtranger, at a great diſtance from his Father and Friends. Hence,</p>

                  <p>The famine deciphers to us the deficiency or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108954:47"/> of ſpiritual ſupplyes, or of Soul-food: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, that then it aroſe, vve muſt take notice that things are many times deſcribed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearance, and not reality: This ſpiritual famine was there before, but the young man, as long as he had ſomething of his own, minded it not, but now when all was ſpent he began to feel it: The ſubſtance of this Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, that a diſtreſſed ſinner ſhal find that the world hath no relief for his ſoul; if a man feel anguiſh and miſery coming upon him and go to the world for help, he ſhal find nothing there but want and diſtreſs; all the world cannot eaſe an oppreſſed ſoul. For further Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The natural man, ſtanding at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God hath no other hope or help to take to in his diſtreſs but the world: This <hi>far Country</hi> is the place which this ſinner dwels in, and therefore here he muſt look for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; he hath by his own grievous folly, put himſelf under the neceſſity, either to find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the world, or elſe to periſh; <hi>i. e.</hi> he knows no other way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay, he hath choſen and preferred the friendſhip and preſumed fidelity of the world, rather than to have his dependance upon God, he went himſelf into this far Country; he was not driven to it by neceſſity, but went to it by choice, it was the place of his deſires; he had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108954:47"/> rather truſt in the uncertain world than a living God; this is a thing ſo natural to fallen man, that <hi>Paul</hi> is fain to give a ſtrict charge againſt it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence in all his ſtraits and wants he goes to the world, and ſeeks his redreſs there, with hopes to find ſupply: This is deſcribed by mens wandring from mountain to hill: The ſinner concludes that if it be not here to be found, it is no where; he knows of no other content or ſoul-ſatisfaction, but what ariſeth out of the duſt, and is to be gotten by the worlds favour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5.

               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. <hi>When God intends ſaving Grace to any, he firſt makes them effectually ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their own miſerable and undone ſtate.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>God, in the ordinary and uſual method of converting ſinners under the means of Grace, begins with the diſcovery of their empty, needy, poor and miſerable condition: Here began the ground and motive of the young man's return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Father, though it did not preſently work to this end; had he not been reduced to the greateſt ſtraits, he had never thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning; his being in want was that which ſet him to ſeeking relief, and this is it which did at laſt (though not immediately) drive him home.</p>
                  <p>Among the works aſcribed to the ſpirit of God, there are ſome which are called common and preparatory; <hi>common,</hi> becauſe they may be found in Reprobates; <hi>preparatory,</hi> becauſe they are wont (in the Elect) to be ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards converſion, or works preparing the ſoul, as a rational Agent to entertain Chriſt as he is tendered in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe works is <hi>Conviction,</hi> which hath two things for objects, <hi>viz. Sin and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> one is the cauſe, the other the effect. Conviction uſually proceeds <hi>Analytically,</hi> it firſt diſcovers the effect, and from thence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108954:51"/> ſearcheth after the cauſe. The conviction of miſery is that which here hath its conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that of ſin follows afterwards. The firſt remove of the young man was, he felt himſelf to be in want, he found when the famine came and encreaſed, that now he had nothing to live upon. In the Explication we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. What is this conviction of miſery 2. How it is wrought? 3. The reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. What is this conviction of miſery?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the firſt legal work that is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in a ſinner, making him to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his preſent ſtate of perdition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that is either in himſelf, or in the world. It is, though not the full of a loſt eſtate, yet leading to it, or a ſtep towards it. In the Deſcription obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I call it a legal work; now Divines are wont to call thoſe works legal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Which are uſually wrought by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Law, in which is the curſe, and by which is the <hi>knowledge of ſin, Rom.</hi> 7. 8. Miſery ariſeth out of the curſe, and the curſe comes upon the breach of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. The Law therefore firſtly diſcovers it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which are common works, and not in themſelves ſaving; and ſo the word legal is often uſed in <hi>Divinity,</hi> of which nature is this before us: Conviction of miſery may befal hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108954:51"/> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 14. Yea, of it ſelf this is hell begun in the ſoul, or conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I call it the firſt legal work: my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that God uſually begins here, and ſo man for the moſt part is made to look upon the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, before he diſcovers the cauſe, yea is led by it thereunto: he firſt ſees and feels miſery upon himſelf, and thence is led to ſee ſin as the blameable &amp; meritorious cauſe of all this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Man uſually apprehends that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, before he apprehends ſin to be the juſt condemnation, he feels himſelf miſerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he juſtifieth God: for though it be ſin which the law condemns, and hence he muſt ſo far ſee ſin, as to know that he hath broken this law, yet he is not made to know ſin in its juſt merit, but rather counts it a rigour of the law which makes him angry, with that and not with ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The proper effect of this conviction is to make him know and feel his periſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at preſent, that he is now going to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is under the curſe of the law, bound over to eternal death, and that he is in the way to it, being held under the curſe: the young man found himſelf periſhing with hunger.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The efficacy of this conviction is that it unmasks the former deluſion under which he lay, making him to ſee that he hath no remedy
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108954:52"/> againſt this miſery either in himſelf, or in the world. In reſpect to himſelf, he finds that he hath ſpent all, in regard to the world, he finds that there is a famine in that land, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that ariſeth from hence is, that he is ſenſibly <hi>in what: i. e.</hi> he ſtill wants that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the curſe, notwithſtanding all God's favours, or his intereſt in the creature, this is the ſumme of this conviction: in which, though we muſt confeſs that there is a change now made in the ſinner, yet it is not a ſaving change of his ſtate. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His ſtate was as bad before, only the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, he then ſaw it not, but now he doth, he thought himſelf rich, and the world a truſty friend: both theſe were miſtakes, and now he finds them ſo to be; ſo that the ſubſtance of rhis charge is, now he is convinced that before he cheated himſelf: Hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſtate is not properly mended by this conviction; for though he ſees his miſery in ſome degree, yet this ſight doth not free him from it: <hi>Conviction</hi> is not <hi>Converſion,</hi> though God can, when he pleaſeth, make it a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: <hi>Conviction</hi> doth not make any man really better, though it doth give us hopes that where the ſpirit begins he may carry it on; for <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> fared never the better by it, though many ſouls have, by Divine Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How this conviction is wrought?</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:108954:52"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If we ſpeak of the Author or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cauſe of this work, it properly belongs to the ſpirit of God, who (in a work of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace) brings the creature to the ſenſe and apprehenſion of this miſery. I deny not but that rational conviction may be gathered and applyed from the rational conſideration of things, but that this ſenſible conviction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a ſpecial work of the ſpirit, appears.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſame means of conviction are uſed with others, who yet are not thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: We preach ſin and miſery to a great many; diſcourſe with them of the diſtreſſed condition of the poor prodigal man; but it is but now and then one that is touched with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce, and cries out of it, or acknowledgeth it ſenſibly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſame means may have been formerly uſed with this perſon, and yet did not gain their effect: It may be he had heard the ſame thing many a time, and his judgment aſſented to it to be truth, but yet he regarded it not, nor was affected with it: yea, poſſibly he had had it more urged, with more ſtrength of argument, and preſſed with more morally perſwaſive motives by others, but yet it never gained upon or got within him till now; and why now rather than at any other time? there was as much to have driven it home be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it muſt needs therefore proceed from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108954:53"/> the power of the Holy Ghoſt working when he ſees meet. But,</p>
                  <p>2. If we ſpeak of the means by which it is wrought, I anſwer, God's ſpirit doth it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the miniſtry of the Word, ſometimes by the concurrence of wiſely ordered Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, ſpeaking in them to the ſoul; and it is a very frequent thing for God to back the Word in his providence for the bringing of a ſinner under the power of this conviction: yea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſometimes begins and gives a general conviction, the Word then ſets in and more particularly points out his condition: Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence many times tells a man that he is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and then the Word comes and tells him how he came to be ſo: More particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Word of God gives a full demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the natural ſtate of all mankind; it tells us both what we are, and how we came to be ſo; it declares the wrath of God, and ſhews how man came to be ſubjected to it; it convinceth by clear and plain evidence; it is a Glaſs in which a natural man may ſee his own face, without thoſe paintings wherewith carnal reaſon is wont to varniſh and hide it. It is one of the ends for which the Scripture is given, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Divine Providence concurrs to the ſetting home of this truth, thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God often brings ſecure ſinners into an
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108954:53"/> afflicted condition, who were before that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and whiles proſperous, they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; but now Gods begins to open their eyes: Thus it was with this younger ſon, <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Context.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this afflicted eſtate men are apt to ponder and think of their condition: Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction puts men upon conſideration, and makes them uſually more ready to hear, and take into their meditation ſuch things as may concern them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now God many times brings home the Word to them, and moves them to a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and particular conſideration of it: Their own concerns are now in it, whereas they looked at themſelves as unconcerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: In proſperity they would not hear, but novv the Word is made more to affect them than formerly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now the ſpirit of God takes an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make many truths which before were very unwelcome to them, and they had put them away, to be thought upon, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, ſo that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They now feel that they are mortal, and muſt go ſhortly to another world, they could not endure to think of this formerly, nor did practically believe it, but now they apprehend it as a reality, and matter of concern.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are made to diſcern that truſt in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108954:54"/> themſelves and in the world is vain, and that by reaſon of the foregoing truth: They now rememher that they have been hitherto think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time, and providing for that, but had forgotten eternity: They thought of no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but in the enjoyment of the world and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of it, but now they ſee that all this will not avail them for an everlaſting ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They now remember the curſes of the Law againſt ſuch as do theſe and thoſe things, or againſt all the progeny of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> in a natural condition, and are convinced that they are the men againſt whom they are denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and now apprehending themſelves haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eternity, and to have done nothing in way of providing for it, this becomes a terrible thought in them; and they are extreamly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the thought of a future ſtate, for which they have been taking no care: The ſeverity of the word, and the fears of death op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, and they know not how they ſhall do to go into another world, and now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be in want, all is leaving them, and they are naked and have no portion, and the world cannot keep them alive, for there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. The thoughts of dwelling with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, poſſeſſeth them with fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> From the uſefulneſs there is of this conviction in order to Converſion: It is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</p>

For the ſeaſonableneſs of it: God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to advance himſelf in man's Salvation, and his Glory being declarative (for his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Glory is incapable of any advancement) hence the more gracious he appears to be, the more Glory redounds to his great Name: Now the greatneſs of grace herein appears in one diſcovery of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſs of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from which the ſubject of this grace is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: For the illuſtration whereof, this work is very fit and ſeaſonable: For, 1. Man muſt ſee his own miſery, or elſe he will never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire God's mercie. 2. The beſt knowledge of this miſery, is by a ſenſible apprehenſion of the diſtreſſing efficacy of it. 3. The ſenſe and apprehenſion cannot be ſo well after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe then the apprehenſion of God's mercy, applyed to faith in the promiſe, cannot but afford ſome relief againſt the ſenſe of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Though it is true, the right improvement of this is after mercy hath been apprehended; yet ſtill the remembrance of this diſtreſs is a main help to fill the ſoul with admiration, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the neceſſity of it in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt in the tenders of the Goſpel. For, 1. Chriſt's work is Salvation work. Hence he is called Jeſus, the Saviour, and ſaid to come on this errand, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. Chriſt came to ſave ſinners.</hi> 2. Hence this work is for

Hence till men feel this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they will certainly deſpiſe Chriſt; till then they will <hi>bid the Almighty to depart from them,</hi> Job 21. 14.</p>

                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. For Information hence learn,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they make more haſt than good ſpeed, that are great Profeſſors of Faith in Chriſt, before ever they were made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of their own miſery. A Faith that antedates Conviction may juſtly be ſuſpected: He that never knew his own diſtreſs, never went to Chriſt as a Saviour. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed divers ſteps from this conviction to true converſion, but yet this is one ſtep from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſecurity, and uſually the firſt: Though a man cannot ſee ſin ſinful (which is the true conviction of ſin) but by an eye of faith, yet, by the common work of Illumination, he may ſee the woful eſtate of it. God, like a wiſe builder, digs for a foundation, before he layes it. Conviction of miſery is not our foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Chriſt is the only foundation, Faith is that which only builds us upon him; but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, the looſe and unſtable earth is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the falſe and failing hopes of men are dug up. God is not wont to give hope, before he hath brought the ſoul to deſpair; he applyes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108954:55"/> not comforts antecedent to conviction. It may therefore put us upon it to enqiure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever it were thus: It may be now you are rich in your own conceit, like <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but did you ever know your ſelves to be <hi>poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked?</hi> if not your riches are but a fancy, and your hopes are empty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there are ſome grounds of hope for thoſe whom the ſpirit of God brings into ae needy and deſtitute condition; whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of their want and miſery; who feel the curſes of the Law, and can find no help in the world: I ſay, there is ſome hope, for there may be reaſon for fears and jealouſies too, For, 1. This is but a common work, and therefore is no ſufficient evidence of God's ſpecial love, no ſure Character of an Elect Veſſel. 2. There have been many under it, who yet through Satans temptations, and God leaving them, have loſt it again; yea, and manifold experience gives in a ſad teſtimony to this truth. 3. The curſe and condemnation is ſtill as really upon them as ever it was: That is not taken off till believing. 4. There is no ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promiſe made to them that God will carry on this work in them to effect: He may or he may not, and if he do not it will leave the man ſhort of Heaven and Glory. But ſtill there is more hope than there was before; for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108954:56"/> while they lay ſecure in ſin, and felt no wrath. they were in no order to Salvation, but now they are in ſuch a way as God brings home his own by; and we may ſay they are a ſtep near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Kingdom than before: Though they are not under ſaving Grace, yet they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means to it: A man that is without the City gates, though juſt by them, is as really without, as one an hundred miles off, but yet he is nearer to</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have here a rule how to begin with men in our endeavours, for their ſpiritual good: Let us labour to ſhew them their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by ſin: We muſt wound before we can heal, inſtrumentally: Be not afraid to ſhew men their ſins and the wrath of God for them: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is the firſt thing a ſecure ſoul is like to be affected withal, and that is preparatory to the rendring of Chriſt precious to them: We ſhould indeed encourage all to go to Chriſt, but encouragements without convictions, are but the laying a foundation for preſumption, and not the way to bring men truely to believe. <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2 Firſt preacheth his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to remorce, and then he directs them to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Thou haſt nothing with thee which can help thee out of this curſed condition, all the Portion of God's common favours which thou enjoyeſt, will not redeem thee out of the hands of wrath, they cannot afford thy ſoul one drop of relief or ſupply; nay, all thy naturall and providential enjoyments are themſelves under a curſe as they are thine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou haſt by a vain and ſinful life, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the favours of God, and thereby made thy accounts the greater; thy condemnation is augmented: thou haſt laid out all upon ſin, and that is the worſt ſort of ſpending that can be, for thou art by it not only made poor, but greatly in debt alſo, and God will call thee to an account for all his goodneſs, and thy riot will enflame thy reckoning.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou haſt been in vain ſeeking thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation among creatures; the world thou goeſt to is under the curſe too for man's ſin, and can yeeld thee nothing but briars, and thorns,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108954:57"/> which will ſcratch and wound, but not relieve thee: They are but the ſhadow of a bramble which will but miſchief him that betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thither for ſhelter: nothing but what will reconcile thee to God, and bring thee in to his favour, give thee a part in Chriſt pay all thy debts, and ſave thy ſoul from hell will do thee any good, and this thou canſt not find here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Death and Judgment and Hell are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thee: Thou art a mortal creature, thy day is coming, and may be nearer than thou art aware of; thou muſt ere long go down to the pit, and then Judgment calls thee to an account, and if thou art not better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, hell receives thee for ever, from whence all thy vain truſt ſhall not be able to deliver thee, <hi>Iſa. 28. 17, 18.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108954:58"/> When once he felt his want, he ſat not ſtill: Senſe of miſery will readily drive the creature to ſeek ſupply: and ſo far he did well: God would not have awakened ſinners to ſit ſtill: but yet he takes a very wrong courſe, and therein he diſcovered his folly: As good ſit ſtill as riſe to fall. The courſe which he took is here expreſt emphatically, and ſet forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; in two things doth the miſery appear which he brought upon himſelf by this courſe. 1. The ſervitude or ſlavery which he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put himſelf upon, illuſtrated and aggravated in two circumſtances. 1. It was his own act, <hi>He went and joyned.</hi> 2. It was <hi>to one of that Country,</hi> to a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>2. The ignoble and ſordid manner of life which he was put to, <hi>to feed ſwine,</hi> which was among the <hi>Jews</hi> accounted the baſeſt life of all, men of that occupation were contemned, none would have any communion with them: Shepherds were of good account, but Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds were not admitted to the ſociety of men.</p>
               <p>That by this <hi>Citizen,</hi> Satan is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is the received interpretation, and his ſetting him to keep ſwine, intimates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible employment and ſervice which he occupieth ſinners about.

The young man thought if he could but put himſelf out to ſervice, he might be in a way to earn a living; ſo convinced ſinners hope they may, by their own pains taking, get ſome eaſe, ſome relief; and if they can but make any ſhift to ſilence conſcience, or cheat their own ſouls, ſo that their preſent terrors need not to make them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raid, they are ſatisfied.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Prodigal</hi> binds himſelf out for a ſervant. The two terms uſed in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> may ſeem contradictory, but they are not: His bondage is neceſſary; when he had ſpent all, and there was no friend to relieve him, what could he now do? he ſaw no other way, but either he muſt bind himſelf out or ſtarve. The curſe that fell upon <hi>Cham</hi> literally, fell upon all mankind ſpiritually: This ſervitude is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe, being a part of the curſe, it falls upon the natural man undoubtedly, being ae puniſhment inflicted upon man by God for ſin, <hi>Joh. 8. 3. Whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> And ye it is.</p>
                  <p>2. Voluntary; men give themſelves up to this ſlavery; they will do it, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. You are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do.</hi> This bondage is man's own choice: Had this ſon been willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his father, the neceſſity had been taken away; but men give themſelves up to ſatan; and the ground of this lyes in the very nature of ſin, which is a relinquiſhing of the ſervice of God and enſlaving a man's ſelf to ſatan. Now this bondage is not bodily ſo much as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108954:61"/> it is an enſlaving or binding of the ſoul to his ſervice, and conſiſts in theſe things.</p>

He is now at Satan's beck, and ready to hearken to, and attend every hint from him, to come and go at his pleaſure; he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the lordſhip of his ſoul, and bids him to take him under his government; hence he is ſaid to <hi>rule in the Children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is ready and forward to do all Satans commands, let them be what they will; he refuſeth none, though never ſo baſe; if he ſends him into the field <hi>to keep ſwine,</hi> he goes readily, and willingly about his buſineſs, ſo ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſlaviſh a ſpirit hath he gotten.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is devoted to his own luſt; for Satan rules in the unregenerate, by leading them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the luſts of their own hearts, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Scripture, called the <hi>luſts of Satan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he buſily ſets them on work, and ſerves himſelf and his own ends by them.</p>

Here he hath his whole dependance or relyance for relief, this is the utmoſt eſſay he hath to make, it is his laſt ſhift, and if this courſe fails him he is undone: As a ſervant expects (at leaſt) food and rayment for his work, ſo the ſinner hopes to get quiet and ſettlement in the ſervice of Satan. Now the reaſon why men do thus often times, after they have been convinced of miſery, lyes here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108954:61"/> this conviction doth not ſo properly put man upon it to get rid of ſin, but to get his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors removed, to get off his fears; and now Satan perſwades him with many wiles to yield to him, and he will effect it, but how poorly he performs it for them, we ſhall ſoon hear.</p>

                  <p>This our Saviour aims at, by the <hi>Citizens</hi> ſetting him to keep ſwine: Swine were of old by the Ceremonial Law reckoned among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean beaſts, and ſtill they are of brutes the moſt bruitiſh: A ſwineherd among men is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the moſt low, ſordid and contemptible employment: Such and ſo vile; yea, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more baſe are thoſe ſervices which Satan Imployes wicked men about; we may conceive of this, if we conſider what it is he puts them upon doing: It is called in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>a fulfilling of his luſts, Joh.</hi> 8. 44. and thoſe are <hi>vile luſts</hi> ſo called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26. If we ſhould examine in particular, what it is that wicked men do, in obedience to Satans will, we ſhall find it all to be filthy and ſwiniſh:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108954:62"/> What is the drunkards employment, but ſwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf, and turning his body into a living cask, and ſo loſing that little of man which he had in him, and wholly becomes a beaſt?

As for the Epicure, Philoſophy it ſelf calls him not a ſwine-herd, but a very ſwine: <hi>Epicuri de grige porcum.</hi> And in truth all luſts are brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh; it hath its ſeat in the ſenſitive part of man, and its higheſt aſpirings are but to give content to the body and ſenſes, with a total ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the ſoul. Let us but conſider what man was made for, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſervice of God, thoſe high and noble employments which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels delight in, and account their glory, and then look and ſee what a world of men are doing, one courting his pleaſures, another chaſing after honours, a third heaping up wealth, a fourth ſtudying his revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of which (in a true judgment) keeping of ſwine is a noble and honourable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And yet theſe are the things with which Satan ſeeks to divert men, and in the purſuit after which he makes them to hope that they ſhall get a living in this famine.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108954:63"/> the Children of men: Who can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expect favour or fidelity from an enemy? It is true, Satan promiſeth men fair, and pretends to be a ſure friend in a time of need, and makes them believe he proffers to do them a kindneſs, and thus with many fair words and deceivable, he draws them after him; but in truth, he hates the whole race of mankind, and all his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And the truth is, Satan's Kingdom is moſt properly a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and it comes to paſs through the righteous judgment of God: Satan being, of a fellow-ſervant, riſen to be a maſter, and man having forſaken God, and joyned himſelf to him, chuſing rather to be at his courteouſie, than under God's directions, the Devil now in ſtead of a ſubject makes of him a ſlave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. See from whence we are fallen by ſin, and learn to be aſhamed of our ſelves: Every unregenerate man hath reaſon to hide his head with ſhame: If one of his fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily had come to this young man, as he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his ſwine, ragged and tattered, and put
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108954:63"/> him in mind of his former condition, how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly he was brought up by the care of a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how think you would he have lookt? would he not have hid his head in ſome buſh? what bluſhing and ſtupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would he have been ſiezed withal? Why this is the very conditon of all men out of Chriſt: Remember therefore what you once were, look back to your former ſtate, when you were favourites of God, adorned with his Image, ſhining with his Graces, and dwelling in his Paradiſe, living in good faſhion, and fitted for the beſt and moſt honourable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But how are you now changed into a company of ſwine-herds; yea, rather into meer ſwine? and that which makes it the more wonderful, is that we ſee men are proud of this employment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. Here we ſee a reaſon why it often fall out that men, after terrible awakenings, and convictions of wrath and miſery, grow more looſe, more vain, more addicted to folly and vanity than before: It ſhews us that they have been uſing of fooliſh courſes, they have gone to Satan for advice, and not to the Spirit of God; and the truth is, Satan is now more buſie, and urgent with the ſoul to hearken to him, and if it do, this is that which alwayes comes of it. Satan evermore directeth men to ſome ignoble courſe or other; ſends <hi>Cain</hi> to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108954:64"/> build <hi>Cities,</hi> that the noiſe of the hammers and and axes may ſilence or drown the voice of Conſcience, ſets the drunkard to his cups, the wanton to his harlots, the vain man to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and God often permits this, to the end that his Elect may be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their own folly and impotency, and of the wonderful riches of his grace in bringing of them home: And as long as men will afford an ear to Satan, it is not to be hoped that ever they ſhould do better. Let us therefore pity ſuch poor ſouls, and yet let us hope and pray for them: Conviction may be a ſeed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and though God ſuffer it to dy, and ſeem to be utterly loſt, in its good time, it may revive again to efficacy, after they have unprofitably made themſelves the Devils drudges, and wearied themſelves in their way; they may be <hi>taken in their months, Jer.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. To awaken poor enſlaved ſinners to think, and ſeriouſly to conſider of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and ignoble drudgery: Hadſt thou one ſpark of that noble ſpirit of man in his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, left in thee, thou wouldſt rather chuſe to dy, than live in ſuch a ſervice: Art thou poor and famiſhing? and doſt thou think Satan can relieve thee? Alas, the beſt that he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee is but that poor world, where thou haſt once already found there is a famine, he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108954:64"/> doth but paint it over in new colours to cheat thee: And for it thou muſt keep ſwine, be a drudge to the vileſt of his luſts, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give thee any better preferment; nay, his very deſign is to make thee a miſerable ſlave here, that. thou maiſt be a damned wretch hereafter. Stay then and conſider before thou goeſt and joyneſt thy ſelf to him; what canſt thou promiſe thy ſelf at his hands, who never did any thing but undo all thoſe that have placed themſelves under him, and put their truſt in him? God is a better Maſter, and if thou wilt come to him, he will give thee a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice, an <hi>high-calling;</hi> he will give thee a clean and not a dirty ſervice, thou ſhalt be a freeman and no longer a ſlave, it ſhall be a Glory for thee to ſerve him, the ſervice it ſelf ſhall be thy honour and felicity, and in the end of it, thou ſhalt be advanced to a throne and a Crown.</p>

                  <p>1. Negatively, not that they are things in themſelves to be contemned undervalued, or in their place and uſe to be deſpiſed. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are the creatures of God, and therefore good in their place and uſe for which he appointed them; God made nothing in vain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. ult.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are outward bleſſings and ſo to be acknowledged by theſe that enjoy them; they are called his <hi>hid treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 17. 14.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. They are ſuch things as we are to pray for in their place, and to deprecate the want of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 11. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are husks when they are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the ſoul as its adequate object: They are not food for ſouls, they cannot give ſatisfaction nor refreſhment to the ſpiritual part of man;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108954:66"/> they are neither ſutable nor ſufficient for that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. They are husks, <hi>i. e.</hi> a truly illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſavingly informed mind puts a low and inconſiderable account upon them, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe better things which the ſoul finds in Jeſus Chriſt: and they plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves in all theſe reſpects to be but husks.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are not fitted to the ſoul of man; they are too mean for it: that is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but theſe are carnal things, that is a durable ſubſtance, but theſe are things that periſh in the uſing, <hi>Col.</hi> 22. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe they are unſatisfying: The ſoul of man is of a large reach, and the deſire of it aſpire after more and greater things than this lower world comprizeth in it; many men complain of too much of the world: <hi>i. e.</hi> Of the cares, and burthens, and perplexities that it brings upon them; but no man was ever yet ſatisfied with it: They are poor empty things, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 5.</p>

And what are ſuch as are full fraught with the things of the world? ſhall we count them rich and happy? I pray what is a Ship-load, or a Ware-houſe full of husks worth?

                  <p n="1">1. An ignorant preferring of the worſt things before the beſt: becauſe he knows not the worth of things, but follows his own fancy, therefore his bauble is of greateſt worth and excellency: If things ſhine, and make a fair

                  <p n="2">2. In the choiſe which they make: And this follows upon the former: a crazed underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, accompanied with a perverted will, makes a mad-man. It was a rule of old to try a fool by his choiſe, preſenting him ſome gay nothing, and ſome other thing of worth: Thus every unregenerate man ſitting under the Goſpel, hath Heaven and Earth ſet before him, fading vanities and everlaſting mercies; and he chuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe poor things, and leaves thoſe other, he runs away with the world, and the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible things of it, and ſcorns the proffers of Grace and Glory, chuſeth a lump of earth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Crown of Stars: The great things of the Law are counted ſtrange things; the little things of the world are excellent things, <hi>Iſa. 66: 3: They have choſen their own wayes.</hi>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:108954:74"/>3. They are indiſcreet and inconſiderate in all they do; fools deliberate not of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they neither ask a reaſon, nor ponder of the event, but go headlong and precipitant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, <hi>Pro. 27. 12. The ſimple paſson:</hi> juſt ſo do unregenerate men; they ponder not any of their paths, but are led blindfold after their luſts, <hi>Iſa. 1. 3.

They are very bold and hardy, they fear no dangers that are before them, and will therefore run themſelves upon any miſchief: If their way be through fire and water, they are not daunted at it, hence our proverb, <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy.</hi> So are ſinners; warnings, threatnings, terrours of the Almighty fright them not; though the ſword of Divine vengeance hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads, though God's judgments are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, and their wicked compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are ſwept away thereby, yet ſtill they hold on their courſe, hence compared to the horſe, <hi>Jer. 8: 6: Every one turneth to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battle.</hi> Of whoſe raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſee, <hi>Job 39. 21: &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108954:75"/> or being convinced of their fooliſh and mad wayes: There is no perſwading a fool or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with reaſon, for wiſdom and counſel is out of his reach: If you fetch all the <hi>Topicks</hi> in <hi>Logick,</hi> and all the <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> in <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,</hi> you may move a ſtone ſooner than him from his notions: Thus unregenerate men are unteachable; you may teach an Ox and an Aſs ſooner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1: 3: Tell them of the evil of their wayes, the unreaſonableneſs of their courſes, bring the witneſs of natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the teſtimony of reaſon, the light of Scripture, and all will not move or perſwade them: Plead, intreat, woo, ſollicit by all that can be ſaid or thought of, <hi>ſurdo canis.</hi> They are <hi>deaf adders, Pſal. 58: 4, 5: Which will not hearken to the voice of charmes, charming never ſo wiſely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are eaſily cheated and impoſed upon: though they will not hear reaſon, yet they are readily begulled and abuſed by fair and fallacious pretences, they may be cogged to give all they have away for a trifle: Truly thus doth Satan, that great jugler, abuſe unregenerate men, he leads them about at his pleaſure, rooks them out of all that is good, perſwades them to neglect God's day of grace, turn their backs upon heaven, deſpiſe a Saviour, trample upon the pearl of price, and all for the ſake of a few fading, periſhing ſhews of carnal content,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108954:75"/> and vain delight: Thus he beguiled our firſt Parents with an Apple, and daily gulls mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſinners, with rattles, and noiſes, and poor empty gay things to the eternal loſs of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They miſchief themſelves and all they come near when let looſe, and left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: It is a property of madneſs to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous: <hi>Fools throw fire-brands and ſay they are in ſport:</hi> Thus unregenerate men delight in nothing but miſchief, undoing their own ſouls, and the ſouls of all they have to do with as much as in them lyes; they run themſelves to everlaſting ruine and deſtruction, and draw as many after them as they can, they will entiſe, allure, perſwade others to be their companions, <hi>Pro. 1. 10. Caſt in thy lot with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. They are moſt angry at thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do them the moſt good: He that binds or ſtops a mad-man, though he loveth him, yet he vexeth him: he accounts them for his greateſt enemies that would give him any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance in his mad pranks; it is as ſafe <hi>meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> as ſtanding in his way: Thus unrenewed men cannot bear to be told of their wayes and courſes, they will count a <hi>Paul</hi> their enemy if he tells them the truth; endeavour never ſo gently and compaſſionatly to perſwade them that they are going away from good, and bringing miſchief upon their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108954:76"/> own heads, it is theway to be hated, back-bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, reviled, and ſpitefully uſed by them: <hi>Ahab hates Micajah, and thinks he never propheſies good to him:</hi> And takes <hi>Elijah</hi> to be the <hi>troubler of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe he reproved his wicked courſes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Correction or puniſhment will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, and bring them to better frame, but rather make them more mad, <hi>Pro. 17. 10. A reproof enters more into a wiſe man than an hundred ſtripes into a fool.</hi> An hundred, nay, if it were a thouſand, his folly would remain with him; yea, you may ſeparate his ſoul from his body, but not him from his folly; although you reduce him to atomes, yet his fooliſhneſs abides ſtill, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 22. Thus are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men ſo rivetted to their ſin, it is ſo intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſeated in them, and diffuſed through them, that all the awful judgments of God make no impreſſion upon them to reclaim them; God may ſmite till he is weary of ſmiting, but they are as bad as ever and worſe, <hi>Iſa. 1. 5. Why ſhould ye be ſmitten any more, ye will revolt more and more:</hi> Like <hi>Ahaz,</hi> in their affliction they will ſin more than ever.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Folly and madneſs diſcovers it ſelf in all they do: A wiſe word or action may ſteal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares from them, but this is the tract of their life, you may read it in the tenor of their courſe: ſo ſpiritual madneſs is in all that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted men do; what is the life of the proud
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108954:76"/> and ambitious, but a pleaſing and priding themſelves in a gay Coat, an handful of dirt, a cap and a knee, an empty title? which is meer foolery. How looks the covetous man, who like a boy ſpends his time in rolling up a great ſnow ball, which melts before the ſun? What but madneſs are all the actions of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, who put off man, and put on beaſt, being brutiſh in all their proſecutions? what doth the paſſionate man, but ſcatter coals, and throw about fire-brands, as if he had nothing elſe to do, but ſet the world in a flame?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. It may teach us not to wonder at all the exorbitancies and confuſions which we ſee acted in the world: when fools and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have gotten the reins in their necks, and act all their own pleaſure without any control, what better can be expected? <hi>The workers of iniquity all of them have no knowledge,</hi> no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then that they act ſo fooliſhly: Nay, much rather have we cauſe to wonder at the power and wiſdom of God, that ſo wiſely orders, and powerfully manageth this great Bedlam, as to carry on his own ends and deſigns in it without control or let, cauſing even the folly of men to pay tribute to his wiſdom.</p>

Wiſdom is too high for a fool.</hi> The ſaving knowledge and ſpiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provment of theſe things is out of their reach: It is labour loſt to go about to inſtruct a man that is beſide himſelf: hence it is not in the power of means to work it; none but God, who can reſtore loſt man to his wits again, and bring him to himſelf, is able to give efficacy to any endeavours of this nature, and till then, <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</hi> are but as ſo much water ſpilt upon a rock.</p>

Be not afraid to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger them, ſo you may but do them good: Think it not hard to be ſcorned, reviled, when you rebuke and entreat them: Alas, if we ſhould ſay or do nothing to them but what they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108954:77"/> like, we ſhould let them undo and deſtroy themſelves, and become guilty of their blood. 3.

It may exhort the people of God, (true Believers) to great thankfulneſs to God for his wonderful love to you, that you are by his grace reſtored to a ſound mind: as, when we look upon one that is diſtracted, and ſee what ſtrange, imprudent, miſguided, fooliſh actions he performs, it is a leſſon to all that look on, ſhewing them how deeply they are bound to thank God, and how much they ow him for their wits and underſtandings: ſo when we ſee what mad courſes prodigal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners drive, how they are carried head-long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own luſts; go from God, ſpend all in riot, enſlave themſelves to Satan, and waſt away their time in the midſt of reſtleſs and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vanities, neither knowing nor regarding an higher happineſs; labouring for husks, and not filling of themſelves, and yet preſuming that they are in a way to do well; Oh, how ſhould you acknowledge that Grace, from whence you have received more noble princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are diſpoſed to higher imployments?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108954:78"/> That he hath given you a judgment and ſpirit of diſcerning between good and evil; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembring that you had been once of that ſociety, and had lived in their Bedlam ſtill, if he who alone is the great Phyſitian of ſouls, had not applyed his grace, and ſo cured you of this diſtemper.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Man is a reaſonable Creature, and a cauſe by counſel of his own actions: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in man is the light in him, by which he regulates all his wayes, and as he ſeeth ſo he practiſeth. The reaſon why ſinful men place their hopes in periſhing things, is becauſe <hi>they call evil good:</hi> This therefore is a main part of man's miſery, that his underſtanding is perverted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. 2, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith, which is wrought in converſion, is grounded upon knowledge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. God dealeth with his creatures according to the manner of their being and acting: Faith is a chuſing, and ſo a cloſing with God; but every choiſe ariſeth from a rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing diſcovery of the ſutableneſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject choſen, and preference which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to deſerve above others: now this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is made to the underſtanding, which is the eye of the mind whereby it ſeeth and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of things. Hence,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is impoſſible that the heart of man, which is naturally glewed to the vanities of the world, and hath been deeply ſetled in his high opinion of it, ſhould ever be made to renounce, caſt off, and utterly to refuſe to have any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108954:79"/> thing more to do with them, or to place any more confidence in them, and make choice of God in Chriſt, and preferr him above all, till he be throughly enlightned in, and fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his own miſery, the creatures empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the glorious fulneſs that there is in God: The things which he hath ſo loved muſt appear to be evil, and the God. whom he hath forſaken muſt appear to be good: an unknown evil is not forſaken; an unknown good is not choſen: Hence the abſence of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the ground of deſtruction. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. Hence converſion it ſelf is often <hi>Synechdochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> called knowledge, and underſtanding, becauſe that is a main ingredient in it: And then a man begins to come to himſelf, when he becomes to have a diſcerning of the truth of things.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108954:79"/> of men when they begin to come to themſelves: If God begins once to cure men of their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, to take them off their wild opinions, and vain conceits of happineſs, in the profits, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and honours of this world, to make them ſee the emptineſs of theſe things, and their own miſery for want of a better ſtay to truſt to, theſe are in an hopeful way to converſion. hence,</p>

               <p>2. VVE are to take a view of the things deliberated, which are two.</p>
               <p>1. Motives and encouragements to return to his father, in the reſt of the <hi>verſe,</hi> 17. in the which we have both the motives themſelves, and the way in which they became beneficial to him. The general truth contained in theſe motives was before a matter of conviction to him, it was that which made him to <hi>be in want,</hi> but it wrought not kindly upon him, till he came, by ſerious conſideration, to apply it more cloſely to his own condition. Before I ſpeak to the motives themſelves, we may a little conſider how he came to improve them, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that word, <hi>he ſaid:</hi> there is a ſpeech of the tongue, and a ſpeech of the heart: the young man had none to diſcourſe with in that far country, he therefore communes with his own heart: the meaning is, he pondered of the matter, conſidered and weighed in his mind, concluded of the truth, and made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to his own condition. Hence,</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:108954:80"/>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. <hi>Conſideration is the first ſtep towards converſion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The firſt thing we find, this young man doth after he came to himſelf is, he begins to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and diſcourſe with himſelf: he firſt pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, then concludes, then acts. Converſion is properly the returning of a ſinner from ſin unto God, emblemed to us by the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s return from a far country, to his father's houſe: The ſinner, before converſion, was going away from God, now he is returning to him. Converſion is conſidered either paſſively or actively; the ſoul is ſaid to be paſſive in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, in as much as he can do nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, till he hath received a principle of ſaving grace: but ſtill we miſtake, if we think that Gods deals with men as with ſtocks and ſtones, and brute creatures: The will of man, whcih is the firſt mover in him, muſt not be forced, but led: The ſpirit, though he dealeth irreſiſtably, yet not violently with it; hence he doth not compel but perſwade: which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a rational conviction, whereby impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made upon the underſtanding, and will, the one being to ſee and approve, the other to embrace the object, which may be called active converſion; when the ſoul viewing and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of thoſe arguments uſed by the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108954:81"/> ſpirit, and imprinted upon him, turns from ſin to God: and thus, though the Spirit of God be the author or efficient of this work, yet he makes uſe of us in the working of it: This is that which I ſay begins at conſideration, and this will appear in a few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1: The natural mans ſinful way is right in his own eyes, unregenerate men, though fools themſelves, and fooliſh in all they do, yet think they are the only wiſe and prudent: <hi>They call evil good; i. e.</hi> they ſo judge of it. The <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> in his vain humour, thought it the only happy life to get abroad into a far country, and riot it among ſtrangers, where he might live at large: Sinners think the way to hell a fair, large, broad, pleaſant way; here they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves to find pleaſures, profits, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; they ſee no hurt in their courſes, and can laugh at the wayes of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as fooliſh and unprofitable. Of theſe the wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov. 14. 12. There is a way which ſeems right to a man, but the end thereof are the wayes of death.</hi> The truth is, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of ſinners think they ſin with a great deal of reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nay, the ſinner hath many ſtrong engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lying upon him to follow his own wayes and courſes: his heart is naturally ſet upon them, ſin is connatural to him; he hath all his dependance for happineſs upon theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108954:81"/> Ever ſince man went away from God, and forſook him, he hath had his dependance upon lying vanities, and in thoſe his hopes are laid up: Nay, there are many entiſing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, fair words, and deceiving flatteries which draw his heart away; his luſts do as <hi>Prov. 7. 21. With much fair ſpeech ſhe cauſed him to yeild, with the flattery of her lips ſhe forced him.</hi> The carnal concupiſcences of the heart of man, are no otherwiſe to be ſatiated, but in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their ſinful wayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. More then this, he is deeply rooted in his way: He is practically fixt in it by cuſtom; it is the trade which he hath lived in all his dayes: He took to it naturally, learnt it readily, and hath lived in it long. Now cuſtom is a ſecond nature, and therefore of much difficulty to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or remove: Mens eſſayes in it are like the waſhing of an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> to get off his blackneſs, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. It is an hard matter to perſwade men to leave off old cuſtoms, though never ſo bad: but beſides this, he is alſo rooted in it by the approbation of his miſperſwaded judgment; it hath gotten room in his heart, and is high in his opinion, and that opinion is ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by obſervation and experience: He hath found it a profitable way, as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 17 It hath been very pleaſant to him, <hi>Prov. 9. 17. Stollen waters are ſweet:</hi> Hence it muſt needs be exceeding difficult, if not impoſſible, to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108954:82"/> make him out of love with it, or think other than well of it: The covetous man finds a ſweetneſs in gain, the voluptuous man in his amorous embraces, the ambitious man in his adorations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beſides this he hath taken up ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the way of converſion; and that partly through the contrariety of his heart and nature to it, in which there is a congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate averſneſs to all which is good; and partly through the temptations and miſrepreſentations of Satan, who endeavours to exhibit it before his thoughts in the blackeſt and ouglieſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that may be; and that both againſt the beginning and progreſs of it; Godly ſorrow, mourning for ſin, forſaking of our evil wayes, turning into the ſtrict wayes of God, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of Godlineſs; theſe are harſh leſſons, and <hi>hard ſayings,</hi> not readily entertained by a ſoul that loves jollity, and cares not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted: the thoughts of ſuch a work and way are frightful, and ſet him violently againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the very firſt motions of it: Theſe are dull, dark, ſtrait, melancholick wayes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the croſs and perſecution that is in them: Hence the natural man is perſwaded to think that there are none who live ſo miſerably and unhappily as the People of God, and if they ſhould be converted, farewel to joy and quiet, they muſt over after be men of ſorrows
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108954:82"/> and contention, and good dayes muſt be at an end with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To true converſion is neceſſarily requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the full and free conſent of the will: for God regardeth the heart, and judgeth of mens actions according as that is in them; ſo, the will is the regent in man, and the firſt mover to every action: If that be true in it, the work is real, if that be deceitful, the work is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical: Converſion is a turning of the whole man from ſin unto God, it is a leaving off the old wayes of ſin, to take up a new life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and how can this be done, ſo long as the heart loves to wander? beſides the will of man never ſtands neuter, though it may hault a while, till the underſtanding hath pondered and weighed things, yet it alwayes comes at length to a concluſion: Men will either love God or Sin, they will either ſerve God or Mammon: Man is a traveller, he will keep ſome way: Hence you ſhall find in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that unconverſion is aſcribed to the will: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11. Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> But when the will is turned the work is done, when the heart is given to God, all is his.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Will will never be gained till all the forementioned obſtructions be taken away. For they are ſo many fortreſſes in which it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and ſecureth it ſelf: As long as the heart remaineth deceived, it is alſo unperſwadable,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108954:83"/> 
                     <hi>Iſa. 44. 20, A deceived heart hath turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that he cannot deliver his ſoul.</hi> Whiles men call good evil, and evil good, whiles a mans own way is right, and pleaſant, and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God's wayes are uneaſie and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, whiles he finds ſubſtance in a way of Sin, and fills his houſe with ſpoil, and he ſees no profit in praying to God and ſerving him, how can he <hi>deſire the knowledge of his wayes?</hi> Nay, he will <hi>ſay to the Almighty, depart,</hi> 44. 16, 17, 18. And till he finds Sin to be bitter, the way of it dangerous, the end death; till he grows weary of this way, and ſees the beauty in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he will never reject his old, and make choiſe of a new way.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The way wherein the ſpirit of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this conviction, is by bringing man under ſerious conſiderations; nor is it to be expected other wayes to be effected, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no truth any further affects us, or moves with us, than as it is applyed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to our minds and conſciences. The truths of the word of God are ever the ſame, for they are everlaſting truths: It was ever a truth, that the wayes of Sin lead to that chambers of death, that they are <hi>bitterneſs in the latter end;</hi> that the wayes of wiſdom are <hi>wayes of pleaſantneſs,</hi> and their <hi>latter end is peace:</hi> but theſe are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truths, and the reaſon why men practice not accordingly, is becauſe they never applyed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108954:83"/> theſe truths to themſelves, or compared their wayes by them; hence that complaint, <hi>Iſa. 1. 3. My People doth not conſider.</hi> And hence that is the firſt direction of the Prophet, <hi>Hag. 1. 5. Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord, conſider your wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This particular application of the truth to our ſelves, is the work of conſideration; this lets in the firſt diſtinct light into the ſoul, whereby it is made privy to its own ſtate, and ſtirred up to ſeek the bettering of it: Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then may be thus deſcribed, <hi>It is a deliberate pondering of ſuch things as nearly concern us, giving credit to them, and drawing uſeful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical concluſions from them.</hi> All this is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word, <hi>He ſaid:</hi> Conſideration is an inward diſcourſe, or ratiocination: but more particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The act it ſelf is a deliberate pondering in the mind: called <hi>Communing with the heart, Pſal</hi> 4. 4. The mind of man is naturally roving, conſideration fixeth it; it is compared to chewing the cud, wherein the food is turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over: It is a looking upon, and into a thing with diligent inſpection, it is called, <hi>a laying a thing to heart, Iſa.</hi> 42. 25. which is a cloſe and ſerious minding and weighing it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter which it is converſant about, is ſuch things as nearly concern us: It is every ones work to look to the concerns of his own
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108954:84"/> ſoul; <hi>if thou be wiſe, be wiſe for thy ſelf.</hi> Our converſion is not advanced in being buſy in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens matters, but in our own, <hi>thy wayes, and thy doings,</hi> is that which the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to be thinking of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which gives weight to theſe things within us, is that we give credit to them; If we do not believe the things, they will be of no moment in our conſideration; many a man hears weighty and ſeaſonable truths ſpoken in the ordinances, but he believes them not, and ſo rejecteth them: Truth muſt be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before it can be improved: Hence that <hi>Pſal 106. 24. They deſpiſed the pleaſant land: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not his word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The improvment of it, is to draw uſeful practical concluſions from it. All truths lead to practice; and that conſideration that iſſues not here is fruitleſs: The work of considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to ſay, <hi>what have I done,</hi> or <hi>what have I to do,</hi> if theſe things be thus or ſo? Now, till the ſoul comes unto this, it is not ſo much as in the way to conversion; for, though the ſpirit draws, yet the ſoul follows, and that not as a blind or dead thing, but as it is affected or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the efficacy of that which leads it ſweetly after, and whereof it can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and render a reaſon for what it doth: Thus <hi>Lydia</hi>'s <hi>heart was touched, and ſhe hearkned</hi> &amp;c, Thus the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> comes to himſelf,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108954:84"/> and then he reaſons within himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. For Information; we may hence learn.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon why there are ſo many under the cleareſt Goſpel diſpenſations, that live and ly in Sin: It is not for want of light, for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truths are written with Sun-beams; it is not for want of evidence, for they are full of demonſtration; it is not becauſe men are not concerned in them, for their everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are therein contained; but it is for want of due conſideration: Men come and go, they hear the Word, the moſt pertinent and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truths; but few make perſonal applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; few enter into their own ſouls and debate the matter with themſelves: It is God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>Jer. 8. 6. No man repented of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> Men ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wayes of Sin, and are bold and fearleſs, though God ſeeth and threatens, and why? Becauſe they do not conſider of this, <hi>Hoſ. 7. 2. They conſider not in their hearts, that I remember all their wickedneſs. Jeruſalem</hi> is obſtinate, till ſhe be ruined, and why? ſee, <hi>Lam. 1. 9. She remembreth not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came down wonderfully</hi> The young fool followeth his harlots, <hi>till a dart ſtriketh through his liver,</hi> and how is this? <hi>Prov. 7. 25. He knoweth not that it is for his life:</hi> The ſons and daughters of men are wilfully blind, becauſe they ſhut
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108954:85"/> their eyes, and will not receive counſel. If men would look into their ſinful wayes, and compare them by the word of God, they might find enough to terrifie and fright them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; but they cannot abide to think of it: If they would enquire into the wayes of God, they might diſcover the purity and pleaſantneſs of them; but they will not ſuffer their thoughts to dwel there: Hence they are called <hi>ſottiſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> Nay, if the ſpirit of God begin to touch and prick them, they are never well till they have baniſhed all the thoughts of ſeriouſneſs, or ſenſe of regret; hence they are compared to men that are drunk and aſleep, that cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to be awakened, and if they are made to rub their eyes, they ſoon fall aſleep again: Hence alſo it is that they cannot endure ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching truths, leſt they ſhould be diſquieted; and thus men go on till they drop into hell for want of conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon why Satan, eſpecially under powerful means, ſo much endeavours to keep men from conſideration, and to divert their minds from pondering the truth; why, if he ſees a ſoul once come to this, he is afraid that he ſhall loſe him: Nothing more afrights this politick enemy, than to ſee ſouls begin to be ſerious: he knows his kingdom is maintained by fallacies, kept up by darkneſs; hence when a beam of light flaſheth upon any conſcience,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108954:85"/> he labours to extinguiſh it, by drawing the mind off; and therefore in the houſe of God, and in the diſpenſation of the Ordinances, he ſeeks to ſtop their ears, divert their thoughts, occupy them ſome other way; ſome he lulls aſleep, others he invites to private diſcourſe, to others he preſents ſome object on which their eyes may be fixed, and he fills others with fancies, which occaſion roving thoughts, that they may not attend: And if any are touched by the word, and begin to be affected, he hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them away, not to their cloſets, but either to their vain company, or ſecular buſineſs; he finds ſomething or other to employ their minds, and fill them with diverſion, that ſo (if poſſible) they may not have no more ſerious thoughts of thoſe matters: This is Emblema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to us, by our Saviour, in the <hi>high way ground,</hi> thoſe fowles of the heaven which pick up the ſeed, are Satan; and by thoſe means it is that he keeps up his authority in the hearts of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reaſon why worldly occaſions or delights, are to carnal hearts ſo great an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to their converſion; why they choak good thoughts, good motions, and this is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the <hi>thorny ground: Cares and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the world</hi> are theſe <hi>thornes;</hi> alas! men have ſo much to do in the world, that it is a wonder if they do not (with thoſe ghueſts,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108954:86"/> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) deſire to be excuſed from coming at the Ordinances; but if they do in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attend them, yet they have no time or leiſure to improve what they hear, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: Men have ſo much to do here in this world, that they cannot find a convenient time to think of the affairs of their ſouls: The clamour of outward buſineſs, ſpeaks ſo much that they have no time to ſay a ſerious word to themſelves about eternity and the things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world: they are alwayes in a crowd and hurry, and there is no room for meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; one hath his Shop to look after, another his Ship to fit out, lawful things, and duties in their time and place; but it is great pity that there ſhould be no thoughts mean while of thoſe greater matters: And hence no wonder that our Saviour ſpeaks of it as a difficult, and miraculous thing for a rich man to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe his mind is ſo taken up, his heart ſo fixed, his thoughts ſo occupied here, that he hears not the trumpet ſound, nor takes the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum of the word, nor ever ſo much as ſeriouſly thinks of an after ſtate, and how much he is concerned in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. For a word of Counſel and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation unto ſinners: Oh, be perſwaded as you love your ſouls, and deſire their good, as ever you would be converted and healed, that you would be intreated to call your hearts to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108954:86"/> an account, and put your ſelves upon ſerious and ſolemn conſideration; conſider your ſtate, your wayes, your end, and for Motive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, your miſery is not leſs, but your danger is greater, becauſe you do not mind it. Naturaliſts tell us of a great (but fooliſh) creature, which, when danger is near it, thruſts its head into a buſh, and preſumes, becauſe ſhe ſeeth not, ſhe is ſecure: Juſt thus it is with poor ſinners, when God threatens wrath, and declares Judgment againſt them, they ſhut their eyes, or ſtop their ears, will not mind it, and now they think all is ſafe: But know it aſſuredly that God will be as good as his word, and what he hath ſpoken ſhall come to paſs, <hi>Whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear:</hi> He that ſleeps at the top of a Maſt, is not in leſs, but more danger of being thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea and drowned, becauſe he is aſleep: And be ſure, hell will be no whit eaſier to bear, becauſe you drop into it unawares.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Know and aſſure your ſelves that you are labouring under dangerous miſtakes: you think you are ſafe and all is well, but you are under the wrath of God, and condemnation of hell: You think your way is your wiſdom, but <hi>this way,</hi> and this thought is <hi>your folly:</hi> you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a way of ſin to be a gainful trade, but you ſhall find it the greateſt loſs, when you ſhall know that it hath loſt your ſouls; you account
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108954:87"/> God's wayes, thoſe wayes of holineſs to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but it is nothing ſo; and if you would rightly conſider, you ſhould find all theſe to be great and groſs deluſions, and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for they are undoing: It's certain that on theſe principles you muſt needs periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seriouſly conſider, that there is yet hope that you might do well: Though you are in the way to deſtruction, yet there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to withdraw your foot, and take hold of the way of life: This the poor <hi>Prodigal</hi> found though he had run far; and indeed there is nothing that hinders your converſion and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but your ignorance, inadvertency, and thence proceeding obſtinacy and wilfulneſs; all that obſtructs is in your ſelves: There are better wayes than thoſe you are going in, think of them: The wiſe woman conſiders a field and buyes it, the wiſe Merchant conſiders a Pearl of great price, and purchaſeth it: What if you part with all for it? it will recompence all your coſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is great raſhneſs in you either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the wayes of Sin, or condemn the wayes of Godlineſs, before you have well conſidered of both: Why ſhould you take up things upon truſt? Why ſhould you ſay of Godlineſs, <hi>This way is every where evil ſpoken of?</hi> How know you but that it is done injuriouſly, and by ſuch
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108954:87"/> who do as little know, and have as little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of it as you have done? The Apoſtles counſel is <hi>to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good:</hi> Prove them by conſideration, hear what each can ſay for themſelves; what God hath to ſay for his wayes, as well as the pleading of Sin and Satan for theirs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Think, it will ſhortly be too late to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to any comfort or profit: They that will not conſider now, ſhall conſider at the laſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 20. But it will be a ſad conſideration, when all the fruit thou canſt reap, by thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, will be only the accuſations of Conſcience, retorting thy incurable and irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable follies upon thee; when its beſt language ſhall be to upbraid thee with precipitancy, and tell thee thou wouldeſt have thine own wayes in deſpite of admonitions, warnings, counſels; thou waſt told of this, what would be the end of theſe wayes; how undoing 2 courſe thou waſt taking; thou waſt entreated to be a little ſerious, and open thine ear to inſtruction, thou waſt proffered better things; thou mighteſt eaſily have ſeen, plainly have diſcovered, and ſo prevented that which now thou feeleſt; they were words of weight which were ſpoken to thee, but thou wouldeſt not hear, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and art therefore juſtly fallen into that pit from whence there is no recovery, and drowned in that deſtruction, from which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108954:88"/> thou mighteſt have been delivered: And is it not better to conſider now, than to deferr it till then? If now thou wilt conſider, it may tend to life, and the ſaving of thy ſoul, and ſo prove thy happineſs; but aſſure thy ſelf, hells conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations will be torments, and fiery reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea, that eating worm that dies not, but ſhall pray upon the ſoul for ever: Be wiſe then in time.

               <p>HAving thus conſidered of the <hi>Prodigals</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation in general, we now come to look upon the motives themſelves, by which he argued himſelf into a reſolution to return to his father; and theſe are two, which do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize under them in general, the two main heads of conſideration; the one reſpects his father, the other himſelf: The order of them is Rhetorically propounded, where the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is laſt placed, in the deliberation: for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108954:88"/> doubtleſs mans neceſſity firſt drives him, or elſe God's goodneſs would never draw him: Proud man will live at home as long as he can. The motives are joyned together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither alone will do, but both together are needful to make a full perſwaſive to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to return to God. Man's miſery through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended, without the diſcovery of Gods mercy, would drive to deſpair; and Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy propounded to a man that is inſenſible of his need of it, would be ſlighted and refuſed: But where theſe two meet in one, the former drives a man out of himſelf, and the latter draws him to God. I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak of them ſeverally.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt motive is taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his own condition, in theſe words, <hi>I periſh with hunger.</hi> As the word <hi>bread,</hi> is <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechdochically</hi> uſed to expreſs all manner of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupplyes, ſo is <hi>hunger</hi> for every want of what is needful for the comfort of man's life; and here, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, it intends the abſence of all that might ſave the ſoul from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: <hi>Hunger</hi> alſo is, by a Metonymy of the effect, put for famine, which produceth hunger, by taking away that which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.

Some
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108954:90"/> thing of the nature of this work. 2. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it in order to Converſion.</p>
                  <p>1. Concerning the nature of this work, of what it is for a Soul to be ſenſibly periſhing with hunger, and how he is brought unto this ſenſe, obſerve; The Spirit of God raiſeth in him a manifeſt and irreſiſtable conviction of three things, which laid together do reduce him to this exigency or diſtreſs; and all this is the work of the Spirit in the means, for; all mens conditions being really one and the ſame by nature, why elſe ſhould not all that enjoy the ſame means of Conviction, be alike apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of it, but the ſpirit imprints it upon ſome and not others? Now the things are theſe;</p>
                  <p>1, He kindles in him an eager and pinching hunger: note that beſides that ſpiritual and gracious hunger <hi>of the Soul after righteouſneſs</hi> mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. there is alſo a preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hunger, which is oppreſſive to, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly diſtreſſeth the ſoul, ſee <hi>Iſai. 65. 13. My Servants ſhall eat but ye ſhall be hungry:</hi> Now this hunger is made up of theſe two things, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A deep apprehenſion of diſtreſſing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery lying upon him, and making his ſpirits to fail, and heart to faint. God opens the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners eyes to ſee and find that which before he neither knew nor believed; that the wrath of God is upon him, that he is a curſed creature,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108954:90"/> that he hath loſt all grace, and is in danger of the miſeries of Hell: he finds his Soul to be in a condition extreamly dangerous, expoſed to the executions of divine Vengeance, he now believes becauſe he feels, that wrath is upon him, ſees a Sword of vengeance drawn againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An earneſt longing to be rid of, and free from this diſtreſs: as the hungry man longs that he may have ſome food; ſo doth the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wiſh earneſtly that his miſery may be eaſed, the cauſe taken away, and the wrath of God impending, removed: he is fearfully amazed at the apprehenſions of the anger of God, he cannot tell how to bear it, or to be able to endure it, and fain he would, if there were any poſſibility, be delivered, <hi>Iſai. 33. 14. Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth not know whither to go in particular for a redreſs, yet in general he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Who ſhall ſhew me good?</hi> yea he cannot ſatisfie himſelf, he is reſtleſs, his ſoul is diſquieted and filled with tumultuations, theſe <hi>terrors make him afraid.</hi> 2. He makes him to find and diſcover that there is no relief to be had in any of theſe wayes and courſes which he hath been taking; and this makes his hunger to be the more diſtroſſing: when an hungry ſtomach meets with a well furniſhed Table, it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have a good appetite; but when
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108954:91"/> hunger and penury meet together, this is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting: When the cravings of the ſoul are inſatiable, &amp; there are no ſupplyes to be gotten for it, this is terrible, ſuch is the condition of the ſoul now, where it thought to have meat, there it can find nothing but husks, and that both,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the world, in which he formerly truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the enjoyment whereof he was wont to ſay to his ſoul, <hi>eat, drink, and be merry, for thou haſt goods laid up for many years.</hi> This world cannot ſatisfie him now; it will not ſtill the cry of Conſcience, it will not comfort him againſt the anger of God, and fears of hell, <hi>Riches cannot profit him in the day of wrath.</hi> He cannot feed and refreſh himſelf upon its fair promiſes, and gloſſing inſinuations-It will not eaſe his troubled mind; but like <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> he cryes out in the midſt of his cups and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; his hiding place of deceit is waſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and he ſees that the world is <hi>empty, and void, and waſt,</hi> Nah. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In himſelf, and his own duties and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: He was wont to pleaſe himſelf in them, and feed himſelf with vain hopes, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear with them, and hold up his head before God; but now he finds that theſe will not ſuffice, they cannot atone God, appeaſe his anger, turn away his fury, or procure him happineſs: They are unprofitable, he hath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108954:91"/> now no more ſelf-ſufficiency, he cannot do what the Law requires, nor pay the debts he ows it, nor pick up any reſolution out of his beſt ſervices, Conſcience now tells him all this is nothing, <hi>Num.</hi> 17. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He cauſeth him to draw this poſitive and ſad concluſion, that in this condition he muſt certainly periſh: He is now ſhaken out of all his vain hopes, fond expectations, wherewith he was wont to feed his fancy, and cheriſh his ſoul: There is now nothing but miſery, hell and deſtruction in his eyes and thoughts: The Law is rigorous, and will be ſatisfied; God is holy and will be glorified; he is by this Law condemned, and hath no ſatisfaction to make to it; the world is a priceleſs thing, and if he had it, it would not be taken in exchange for a ſoul; and thus, between longing and deſpair he is ready to faint and die: This whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is amply deſcribed to us in apt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent metaphors, <hi>Iſa. 41. 17. The poor and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Touching the neceſſity of the work in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to converſion, we may obſerve.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That converſion is the turning of a ſinner from ſin to God: Now Sin is properly the rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the creature upon ſomething elſe which ſtands in competition with, and oppoſition to God, which thereforeit muſt leave, or elſe it's
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108954:92"/> impoſſible that it ſhould come to him: he that goes to one contrary, muſt in ſo doing go away from the other; the Apoſtle oppoſeth theſe two, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 15. That they truſt not in uncertain riches, but in the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Converſion the ſpirit of God comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, and fills it with his Grace; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which filling it is needful that the Soul be firſt emptied, for as long as a Man is full of himſelf, of the World, of his carnal hopes, of his legal righteouſneſs, there is no room for the ſpirit of God, hence he comes to the poor and needy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In active Converſion, there is a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of the Soul: the will of man is that which doth firſt renounce Sin, Satan and World, and lay hold upon Chriſt; now a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary action is the action of a reaſonable creature, applying himſelf to his object, not upon compulſion, nor by the force of inſtinct, but by the inclination of his own mind; ſo that as he doth it willingly, he alſo (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) doth it rationally, or upon ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended grounds: and from this it will appear, how needful it is that a Sinner be made thus ſenſible in order to his Converſion: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Man by nature is a proud Creature, and loth to go or be beholden to any other as long as he hath any hopes to do well of himſelf:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108954:92"/> This appeared before, in the conſideration of the ſordid courſe the needy <hi>Prodigal</hi> took to ſupply his want.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man is naturally moſt oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, and will not (be ſure) come to him until he be driven: It is very evident, that he will try every way, turn every ſtone, uſe all means to do well otherwayes, before he will betake himſelfe to God: the Prodigal will live meanly, fare hardly, ſcramble, and debaſe himſelf if that will do rather than return to his father's houſe: as long as a ſinner hath any hopes that he can make a ſhift to keep up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſinking, he flyes not unto God: (the Raven; if he can have carrion to light upon and feed of, returns not to the Ark:) for till now he hath no need of God: A man muſt: be ſick before he will ſend for a Phyſitian, and dangerouſly ſick, heart ſick, before he will ſend for one whom he hates, other Phyſitians muſt firſt fail him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In Converſion there muſt be a whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon God, and that muſt preſuppoſe an litter rejection of all other helps and props, <hi>Hoſ. 14 3. Aſhur ſhall not ſave us,</hi> &amp;c. Now man hath naturally ſuch an opinion of himſelf, and of the creature, that till he be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its emptineſs, he will not forſake it, and till that he cannot cloſe truly with God, who will not be a divided truſt, or part glory
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108954:93"/> with another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. For Information, here we ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon why Jeſus Chriſt and his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are no more welcome and acceptable to the moſt of men, and ſo why the work of converſion is ſo rare and infrequent even there where the Goſpel comes with moſt clearneſs; it is becauſe the moſt of men have yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own to live upon; they have not ſpent all, they are not nipt with the famine. Though all natural men are prodigals, yet they have not as yet made away with their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſtill have ſomething to ſupport them; they do not feel themſelves poor peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing creatures; but are like <hi>Laodicea, Rev. 3. 17. Rich and want for nothing.</hi> Tell them of the riches of grace in Chriſt, the full fupplyes that are with him, that he hath where withal to ſatisfie the hungry ſoul, what care they? they need it not, the are not hungry and pincht; the moſt of the children of men think they can do ſufficiently without Chriſt, <hi>therefore they ſay to him depart from us, Job</hi> 21. 14. The Goſpel invitations are preſented to poor, blind, ſick, periſhing ſinners, and therefore men do not take it to themſelves, they hope they are not ſuch: and therefore, till we ſee men diſtreſſed, till we find them deſpairing, till we hear them crying out ſenſibly of their woful miſery, we muſt not expect they ſhould do any other then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108954:93"/> complement with Jeſus Chriſt, and, with them that were invited to the Goſpel feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. to frame excuſes, and uſe delayes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What need there is of preaching the Law, or legal truths in the dayes of the Goſpel: It is true, Chriſt is the end of the Law, and Chriſt only ought to be preached: <hi>i. e.</hi> as the ultimate ſcope of all Divine truths: But, as the Law was of old, ſo it is ſtill, a School-maſter to Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make men ſee and feel their need of Chriſt: And truly, without it men will never give him that true welcome which he deſerves in their ſouls: This is the right Glaſs in which man is made to ſee his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to underſtand his miſery; this is it that diſcovers man to be a bank-rupt, the world an empty, hungry place; this diſplayes man's ſin, Gods Juſtice, and our own utter inability, and all this is the very ground-work of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to feel our ſelves periſhing: God will humble ſinners before he will ſave them; he will make them come to Chriſt for need, and not in complement. They are therefore ſtrangers from the methods of God's grace, that brand this with the aſperſion of legal and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Goſpel, whereas it is neceſſarily introductive.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The uſefulneſs of affliction in order to the converſion of ſinners, and the reaſon why God is many times pleaſed to lay theſe chains upon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108954:94"/> them; why they are very ſutable for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward this great affair in the ſoul: Hence when God would do <hi>Ephraim</hi> good, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. with 6. 1. and ſee for this alſo, <hi>Job 37. 16. &amp;c.</hi> Man is high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſelf-conceited, when he hath his health, ſtrength, wealth and honour in the world; he is too good to be ſpoken to: but affliction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth him, it helps to bore his ear, it puts him upon conſideration, which we heard is the firſt ſtep to converſion: Affliction is a School in which a ſinner is ſet to ſtudy, here is his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vain truſt anatomized; here his miſery begins to appear, and he finds how he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his own ſoul. Not that affliction of and by it ſelf will open a blind eye, or ſoften an hard heart: There are many that are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made worſe by it, but when God is pleaſed to ſet in with it, it hath that in it which is of uſe to help man to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf: Be not then angry with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a ſoul ſenſible of, groaning under, and ready to dy by reaſon of the oppreſſion of his ſpiritual diſtreſs and want, is not far from the Kingdom of Heaven: I know their is a deſpair through the weight of horrour, that ſets a ſoul further from good, and drives him to hell with violence, ſuch was <hi>Cain</hi>'s and <hi>Judas</hi>'s. And truly, ſeparate this ſtate from the ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108954:94"/> of the Goſpel, and it is the cleareſt Emblem of hell upon earth that can be: But yet in the Goſpel-way Chriſt is near to ſuch a ſoul to tender himſelf to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 17. Yea his ſpecial invitations are to ſuch, and all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is ſet before them, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Ho, every one that thirſteth, come to the waters.</hi> Mat. 11. 28. <hi>Come to me ye that are weary and heavy laden.</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>Let him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt come.</hi> Till it comes to this, our hopes for man are built but upon general propoſitions, God may call them, it is poſſible, becauſe they live under the Goſpel, and under the means, &amp;c. But now there is hope that God is doing the work: And, as when the pain of a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman encreaſeth, there is expectation that ſhe will ere long be delivered, ſo theſe cryes give encouragement, that it will not be long ere Chriſt be formed in ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. For Exhortation, let it ſerve to call upon and invite every unregenerate ſinner to ſerious and ſolemn conſideration of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is periſhing, ſtarving, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, dying: It is the ſaddeſt ſight in the world to ſee poor miſerable men and women dying, and they ignorant; dropping every day into hell, becauſe they have nothing to live upon, and yet not conſider. If you ask me who is intended by this periſhing <hi>Prodigal;</hi> I anſwer, if thou art unconverted thou art the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108954:95"/> perſon; and that thou mayeſt be convinced of, and made to apprehend it, take into thought theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thy poor ſoul muſt have ſomething to live upon, or elſe it will periſh everlaſtingly: This is a truth that man little thinks of, hence he cares onoy for his outward man; but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, man is every way a dependent creature; if the ſoul have not ſpiritual food to live on, it muſt needs dy: as the life is loſt without food, ſo is the ſoul loſt without Chriſt, hence called <hi>our life. Col. 3. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou haſt nothing in thy ſelf to live upon, and therefore in thy ſelf art certainly periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Such is the condition of every ſoul out of Chriſt, he is going to deſtruction: Look upon thy ſelf and thou ſhalt find in thee all the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a periſhing creature: all thou hadſt to live upon is ſpent, or, I am ſure, will be ſpent without thy profit: Original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs thou haſt loſt already, and thy vain and carnal hopes thou wilt loſe ſooner or latter: thou art a law breaker, art under the curſe, ſentenced to dy everlaſtingly; God, in whoſe favour alone is life, is thy Enemy; the Law, in obedience to which thou mighteſt have lived, is broken by thee, and calls for thy deſtruction; thou haſt nothing to redeem thee from the efficacy of it; thou haſt no power to obey it, no price to ſatisfie with for thy viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108954:95"/> of it; thou haſt loſt the Image of God, thou haſt loſt the favour of God, thou haſt loſt ſtrength to obey him, thou art faſt bound in cords of vanity, Divine vengeance is purſuing hard after thee, the mouth of the pit is open to receive thee; and who then is ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if thou art not?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The things which thou ſeekeſt to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt upon for thy relief, they <hi>are not bread:</hi> They will not feed and ſupport a dying ſoul: the worlds faireſt banquets are but a ſhew, and have no ſubſtance in them, they are husks, Swines, but not mans meat: Doſt thou truſt in riches? <hi>They will not profit in the day of wrath.</hi> Doſt thou rely upon friends? <hi>They cannot by any means redeem thy ſoul.</hi> Doſt thou content thy ſelf in pleaſures? <hi>Thou art dead alive.</hi> Doſt thou feed thy ſelf with honours? neither they nor thou can <hi>abide, but thou art like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> Strip thy ſelf out of theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God will elſe ſtrip thee ſhortly; and then ſee what a forlorn eſtate thou art in: Thy hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſoul is put off with a <hi>ſtone</hi> for <hi>bread,</hi> and for a <hi>fiſh,</hi> a <hi>ſerpent;</hi> and all thy hopes here are periſhing hopes, and when they leave thee, thou muſt periſh too.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt only hath that bread which can ſatisfie thy hunger, and ſave thy life; but thou art at an everlaſting diſtance from him, thou art in a farr Country a great
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108954:96"/> way off: In particular,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou art far from having any will or deſire to go to him for it: The unregenerate ſinner, though dying, yet <hi>will not come to him for life, Joh. 5. 40.</hi> It is the great miſery of ſinful man, that he <hi>will dy, Ezek. 33. 11. Why will ye dy? i. e.</hi> he will do ſo rather than repent and return to God, and ſeek his grace in his way: There is bread in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but you will not go thither for it, eternal life is only for comers, but you refuſe to come that you may have it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are far from having any power or ability to come to Chriſt; that rock, which is the Magazene or Store-houſe of bread for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing ſouls, is out of your reach, <hi>hygher than you are,</hi> and, without an Almighty arm to lift you up into it, you will ever fall ſhort of it: God muſt draw before ever the ſinner can come: Your <hi>Pit,</hi> as it hath <hi>no water in it,</hi> ſo it is deep, and you have no ladder to climb upon, nor legs or hands to aſcend withal, if you had one; thus it is with you, and now what will you do?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God is under no engagment or obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, to do this kindneſs for you, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring you this bread of life to ſave you from famiſhing; nay, he hath many provocations to refuſe ſo to do: You have undone your ſelves, your riot hath brought this poverty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108954:96"/> upon you; yea, you have been putting of this Grace away from you; you have loved lies and deceits, <hi>embraced lying vanities, and hated your own mercies.</hi> Think of theſe things, and now ſay whither it is good, a ſafe, a deſireable condition you are in? So are all unconverted ones; let this affect your hearts: One would think it ſhould make mens ſouls dy within them, to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the death which they are dying; a death of hunger, the very worſt, and moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and calamitous ſort of death: Oh that men felt this now! there were then hopes that they might have relief, whiles the bread and water of life are exhibited in Goſpel ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: but if you will not know nor believe it now, you muſt be made ſenſible of it in a more amazing hour, when you ſhall tire hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with endleſs and fruitleſs cries, and ſhall not be able by them all to prevail ſo far, as to obtain, in that everlaſting famine, ſo much as one drop of water to quench the heat of your torments.</p>

               <p>2. THe ſecond Motive is taken from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in whom he obſerves two things. <hi>Viz.</hi> Plenty, and bounty: for <hi>he had enough and to ſpare:</hi> Bounty, for ſo much was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his <hi>hired ſervants,</hi> from whence he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, he will not, if I go, ſuffer me, who am a Child to periſh; and therefore joyns to theſe, his relation to his plenty, it was his father that had it.</p>
               <p>The main difficulty in the words is to know what is meant by, or alluded to in theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervants that were ſo well provided for: ſome by theſe underſtands viſible Members of the viſible Church, that were only outward profeſſors, and not ſincere, who, like hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, only ſerve God for ſiniſter ends; and then by bread they underſtand Ordinances, as Prayer, Preaching, and the Sacraments, of which they have enough and to ſpare, more than they would care for: The word is, <hi>do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> a Metaphor from a fountain that runs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108954:97"/> over; nor doth I wholly reject this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from being part of the meaning, and may teach us thus much; That an enlightned ſoul expects his ſpiritual food in and by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. But it ſeems to come nearer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſinner in ſuch a ſtate as we have been conſidering, if we look upon the phraſe to have no particular alluſion, but only to be a comparative illuſtration of Divine bounty: Hyred ſervants in great houſes are not wont to be greatly cared for; he is a bountiful houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper indeed that feeds ſuch plentifully. Or it may be an alluſion to the general care which God takes of all his creatures, as he is Lord of the world and provider of the great family of the earth, even the worſt and meaneſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Job</hi> 38. ult. but I ſhall not be over cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.

                  </head>
                  <p>It is wondrous relief to a deſpairing dying ſoul, to conſider and believe that God hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to anſwer his wants, and is a God very bountifull to his Creatures. In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication conſider. 1. What manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement this affords? 2. What of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement ariſeth therefrom? 3. That it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for periſhing ſinners.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:108954:98"/>
                  <p>1. What manner of encouragement this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are here to conſider that the <hi>Prodigal</hi> was not yet returned, nor returning to his father, but only upon deliberation about it; nor yet come to a reſolution in the thing; in which reſolution may be obſerved (when we come to it) the firſt working of ſaving Grace, ſo that the encouragement which is here denoted is that which helped him to a preparatory hope, and was a mean to keep him from utter deſpair. That there is ſuch an hope, is aſſerted to by our Divines; an hope before faith, keeping the ſoul from falling into deadly diſcouragement, or utterly refuſing to attend upon any means for his good, which muſt needs be the fruit of utter deſpair. Hope of obtaining the end, is the very motive to uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means: Did not the periſhing ſinner conceive ſome hope that he might find good in the ways of Gods appointment, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reject them. Now this hope is not an effect or fruit of juſtifying faith, but precedent, and oftentimes in order to it. And if we carry in mind, that the ſpirit of God deals with ſinners after the manner of reaſonable creatures, we may the better conceive of this hope, and the encouragment ariſing from it; which may be in a few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſoul of man abſolutely needs ſome
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108954:98"/> object to rely upon; man's dependance for ſoul as well as body is out of himſelf; that muſt have ſomething to live upon, or elſe it cannot do: Man was made for an end, and the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his end is the fruition of his object, hence the Church calls <hi>God the portion of her ſoul,</hi> Lam. 3. 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence the ſoul can hold up no longer than it hath ſome object to depend upon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really or imaginarily able to ſupport it: The ſoul therefore ſinks when it hath nothing to truſt to; and that is the proper nature of deſpair, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinking of a ſoul for want of a ſtay: and the reaſon why every ſinner is not a deſponder, is only becauſe he ſtayes upon the things of the world, and hopes they will ſupport him; hence they are ſaid <hi>to truſt in them,</hi> Pſal. 49. 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God and the creature cannot both be a man's ſtay: Theſe are ſet in oppoſition in the Scripture, and will alone be our confidence, or not at all, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 12. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle oppoſeth theſe two truſts to each other 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence in order to converſion the ſoul is broken off from his hope, truſt, or reliancy upon any created being: he is made to find himſelf, with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> a bankrupt creature living in a famiſhing world, which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but husks, and he cannot feed upon
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108954:99"/> them: he ſees <hi>Aſhur cannot ſave,</hi> he is in a pit wherein no water is, and now he is ready to dy, periſh, can find no comfort here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In this ſtate there is nothing but hope can ſuſtain the ſoul from utterly deſpairing, and without this the heart would certainly break: For, that man who knows that he muſt certainly periſh without help, and all help which he relyed on utterly fails him, hath only this to relieve him, to hope that help may come ſome other way, elſe his heart muſt ſink and dy within him. Now this hope muſt be prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It flows not from an intereſt in Chriſt, for it is the encouragment of a ſoul that hath been eſtranged from him to go to him; for God allures the ſoul to Chriſt, by ſetting this hope before him, and effectually perſwading him to embrace it; and it is the uſual method, of the ſpirit to come in with it into the ſoul; ſo <hi>Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim, Jer.</hi> 31. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ariſeth only from a poſſibility, or at furtheſt a probability that he may here find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and obtain a full ſupply of all the good he needs, and not from a certainty, or promiſe, or covenant in which he may claim it: you have it expreſſed in <hi>Jonah, 3. 9. Who knows but the Lord may be gracious?</hi> The ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul hears news that there may be a redreſs had for him, that there is one who not only
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108954:99"/> can do, but hath done as much for ſuch as he, which makes him to bear up, and puts him upon waiting in the uſe of means.</p>
                  <p>2. What of encouragment ariſeth from theſe conſiderations?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is the only Rational encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an humbled ſinner: He can find none with looking elſewhere: if he look upon the world he ſees nothing but famine; if upon himſelf, he hath ſpent all, and is utterly undone, it is only in God that he can expect to find any relief. Now the Soul is not firſt made to believe, and then ſee the reaſon of it, but the ſpirit of God draws the ſoul to believe, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſee the excellency of the object, and ſo perſwading it; he is firſt made to ſee the ground of hope, and then to follow, as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> here. Now both of theſe Attributes are full of encouragement.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſufficiency of God; it cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> to think that there is bread enough and to ſpare in his fathers houſe: Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beggars are not wont to ask relief of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars like themſelves, but they go to the rich: Men account it vain to ask an alms where they know there is nothing to be had; but where they underſtand there is enough, they will be very importunate, becauſe they know ſuch an one can, if he hath an heart to it, do them a kindneſs: So, here the ſoul diſcovers
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108954:100"/> a poſſibility that he may have ſuccour, becauſe God is able; there is all fulneſs in him, he can ſave him from hell, and wrath, and miſery, and beſtow life and ſalvation upon him if he ſees meet: When <hi>Jacob</hi> heard there was bread in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſaid to his Sons, <hi>Why do you ſit ſtill and look one on another, and dy?</hi> So, when a ſoul hears there is all Grace with God, it prompts him to ſay, why do I tarry here then, and periſh? God therefore thus propounds himſelf to deſtroyed <hi>Iſrael, Hoſ. 13. 9. In me is thy help.</hi> And Chriſt propounds it as a queſtion to them in order to their cure, <hi>Matt. 9. 28. Believe ye that I am able to do this?</hi> Now poſſibility appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended gives eaſe to extream neceſſity, and when a ſoul hears of it, it will not caſt off all hope, till it hath made utmoſt proof, and hence the ſoul is helpt to come to Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, hence the poor Leper makes this his argument, and comes with it: <hi>Mat. 8. 2. If thou wilt thou canſt make me clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The bounty of God added to his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency gives further ſtrength to hope, in that it diſcovereth more than a poſſibility, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome probability: The Fathers bounty to hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, made the ſon think, he not only hath enough, but is very free of it, why then may not I, who am a ſon, though a <hi>Prodigal,</hi> make proof of it? Beggars go more chearfully to, and knock more liberally at a bountiful man's
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108954:100"/> door, becauſe they are ready to promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves relief; not that they deſerve more of him than of another, but becauſe he is more ready to communicate his favour than a churle is: When a poor ſinner conſiders how kind God is, how full of mercy, how liberally he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes his favours, how he deals his kindneſſes undeſerved; and ſcatters them, not with a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but bountiful hand, now, thinks he, why may I not ſpeed? why may not I come as well as another, and hope to find him kind to me, as well as others have done? Hence God puts this argument into their mouths, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 3. With thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi> You find <hi>David</hi> makes a plea of this, <hi>Pſal. 86. 5. Thou, O Lord, art good, and ready to forgive.</hi> Now, though the ſoul have never a promiſe to rely on (for that is received in believing) yet he hath a ſupport againſt deſpair, and argument to drive him to go to God for his mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this encouragment is of uſe only to periſhing ſinners: The <hi>Prodigal</hi> comes not to this thought till he is at an utter loſs, and he joynes it to that conſideration, <hi>I periſh with hunger:</hi> And there is great reaſon for this, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As long as a ſinner hath any thing at home, he minds not nor regards God, but ſaith to the Almighty, depart; men that have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies within doors will not go abroad, and
<pb facs="tcp:108954:101"/> knock at other doors for relief: Hence, to a proud and carnally confident ſinner it is no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that God hath bread enough, and is ready to diſtribute it to ſuch as come and ask it, for what is that to him who needs it not, who is full, and wants for nothing? He feels himſelf well and luſty, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may go about his buſineſs he hath no need of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence alſo theſe encouragments are not nextly and immediately exhibited to ſinners, till they come to this ſtate and ſenſe: The Goſpel is not properly preached to men till they are prepared for it by the Law: Chriſt therefore ſaith, <hi>that he did not come to call the righteous: i. e.</hi> men rich with the opinion of their own ſanctity; <hi>but ſinners, i. e.</hi> ſuch as were ſenſible of ſin. It is the hunger-bitten ſoul that longs for bread, the faint and thirſty that hearkens after ſprings of water. Chriſt propound his Grace to ſouls when it is like to be welcome: theſe therefore are wont to go together, ſenſe of utmoſt diſtreſs, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the riches and readineſs of Chriſt for ſuccour; the firſt of theſe without the ſecond breeds diſpair, the ſecond without the firſt meets with ſcorn and contempt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. For Information;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he that would have any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wait on God for grace, muſt ſeek it in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108954:101"/> God alone and not in himſelf. The through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awakened ſinner muſt indeed look both on God and himſelf too; but he muſt ſee in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nothing but ground of diſpair, and all his hope in God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9. This therefore daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their hopes, who would fain find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that which may encourage them; and are therefore made to deſpond, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, the greatneſs of their ſin, &amp;c. this alſo may encourage thoſe that ſee the worſt in themſelves, none like them for ſin and miſery; why God is the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they lay blocks in the way of their own converſion, that only ſit poring upon their own miſery, and look no further: What good would it have done the poor <hi>Prodigal,</hi> to have only ſat, and wrung his hands, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I periſh, I periſh?</hi> If he had looked no farther he had periſhed indeed. Though we muſt begin here, yet we muſt not end here, but look further for encouragement. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed man's enquiry is, where ſhal I have help? and ſo muſt yours, and now the ſpirit of grace is ready to direct you to one that is both able and full. therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. Let it be for a word of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe that are at the point of death, who feel themſelves miſerable, but neither in themſelves nor elſewhere can find deliverance, and are (poſſibly) ready to paſs a ſad ſentence
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108954:102"/> upon themſelves, that there is no hope for their ſouls. Thou haſt ſeen an end of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perfection, thou haſt come to the bottom of thine own confidence; thou haſt found an empty world, felt an empty ſoul; but didſt thou never hear of God, or haſt thou never tryed him? If not, do not yet deſpair; firſt ſee what he can and will do for thee: you will ſay, I have tryed many courſes and they fail, and I am diſ-heartened; well, but this is a way never yet fruſtrated thee, and let theſe Attributes put a little comforting hope into thy ſoul; conſider then and believe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God is able to help thee: He hath all that, and more than all that which thou needeſt: He hath eternal life with him to give to all thoſe that ask it of him; thou art ſtarving, but he can feed thee, thou art periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but he can ſave thee: God loves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his power to us, that we may take hold of it, <hi>Iſa. 27. 5. Let him lay hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with him.</hi> Look upon him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As he is God: That word is enough to tell thee he is able; God thinks it a word big enough to encourage his deſponding, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpairing people, <hi>Iſa. 45. 22. Look unto me, for I am God.</hi> The reaſon why thou canſt find no help among the creatures, is becauſe they are not God, <hi>Iſa. 31. 3. The Egyptians are</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:108954:102"/> 
                     <hi>men, and not God.</hi> And that you may know what he can do as God, look upon the work of Creation: when God would hearten his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rely upon him, he calls up their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hither, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 24, 25. 12. 15. What cannot he who made a world out of nothing, do? Could God call for a world, and it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his call, and can not he ſave a poor ſinner from periſhing? doubtleſs he can: what ſerve all the Divine Attributes for, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the greatneſs and immenſity of the power of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he is God in Chriſt: And there you ſhall ſee how he is not only abſolutely able, but alſo ſutably laid in with ſufficient ſupply to ſave the periſhing ſouls of prodigal ſinners from perdition: Chriſt is a great Store-houſe, in whom is laid up all proviſion needful for the famiſhing poſterity of fallen <hi>Adam:</hi> the great diſcouragement of a convinced ſinner is, how can God do it and be juſt? Though there be a fountain of goodneſs in God, able to ſatisfie the ſoul that enjoyes it, yet ſin hath ſtopt up the channel, and Divine Juſtice interpoſeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the ſinner to dy: But now in Chriſt all theſe Channels are opened again; he hath ſatisfied Juſtice, and ſo broken open a new and and living way to God, and preſented him ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a Throne of Grace; and thus God is able, notwithſtanding his Juſtice, to open trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108954:103"/> of many to ſinners, and fill every hungry ſoul with good things. Divine ſufficiency is by this means rendred communicable to the Children of men: And it is in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph. 3. 20. He is able to do more than we can ask or think.</hi> Otherwiſe it had been a mockery put upon dying ſinners, to have told them of abundant ſtore of Grace and good, which it was no wayes poſſible for them to come at. Now it is your work and buſineſs to apply this to your condition, and ſay, though I am periſhing, yet there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility that I may be ſupplyed; though the world cannot relieve me, yet God can, and that not only by abſolute power, but in a feiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of his own finding out: I may then live and not dy: And the very belief of this probability hath driven many a ſoul to him; and thou maiſt, as well as the poor leper, frame a petition and argument out of it; <hi>If thou wilt, thou canst.</hi> Out of doubt it opens a door of hope, for a ſoul to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if God will, he can both ſave him and be juſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God is bountiful, and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch as are in want: This may add to thy encouragement and hope, though thou art not certain that he will help thee: The <hi>Prodigal</hi> did not know that his father would look upon him, but he knew him to be kind, and that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108954:103"/> put him foreward; ſo it ſhould do thee; hence God hath written his Name in letters of goodneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. And to help here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider how much God doth for ſuch as never return to him, nor ask mercy of him: God's general <hi>goodneſs</hi> ſhould <hi>lead</hi> ſinners <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Rom. 2. 4.</hi> When you ſee how God ſpares prophane and wretched ſinners, and ſuffers them to live; yea, provides liberally for them; fills them with hid treaſures, gives them more than heart can wiſh, and the waters of an overflowing cup are wrung out unto them, ſo that their hearts are filled with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they crown their heads with Roſe-buds, and <hi>ſpend their dayes in wealth, and leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue to their babes:</hi> Argue from hence, what goodneſs hath he then in ſtore for them that humble themſelves, forſake their ſins, repent, and return to him with their whole hearts?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider how many repenting <hi>Prodigals</hi> have upon their return been entertained and made welcome by him, who once did as thou haſt done, run themſelves out, ſpent all, and were ready to famiſh, but, betaking themſelves to him, they were fed, and ſaved alive, and this may give you hopes to find the like favour at his hand; Conſider therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were ſuch who as little deſerved this favour as thou: they had nothing of merit for which they ſhould be bid welcome, and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108954:104"/> in their diſtreſs, for all mankind ſtand guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They had gone away from him, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted all in riot, as thou haſt done: What a <hi>Prodigal</hi> was <hi>Manaſſeh?</hi> how miſerably had he run himſelf out? yet he obtained favour: What a great ſinner had <hi>Paul</hi> been? yet he was accepted,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They were ſuch as had as little to plead for themſelves as thou haſt: They had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to plead but mercy, condeſcending mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, undeſerved mercy: they had no more to ſay for themſelves than the poor publican had, <hi>Lord have mercy on me a ſinner.</hi> For themſelves, or of themſelves, all they could ſay, was only to make this poor <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s acknowledgment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. and yet were not rejected, but found mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider what relentings there are in the hearts of men, eſpeciall of Parents towards their Children: for, that is the ſcope of the Parable, to argue from the leſs to the greater; <hi>q. d.</hi> If a father can have ſo much mercy, a poor man, that hath but a little kindneſs, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pitty with him, what may we hope then that God will do? Can a <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſo argue from his fathers bounty, and encourage himſelf by it? how much more a poor guilty ſinner from the bounty of God, with whom are <hi>everlaſting mercies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:108954:104"/>4. Conſider how richly God hath entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed returning ſinners. The pooreſt, meaneſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath enough and to ſpare, no Believer in Chriſts family wants for any thing; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is fulfilled, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 10. God hath done for them more than they can expreſs; and though they ſometimes ſeem to complain, yet it is their infirmity and infidelity: What can a Believer want which he hath not? Pardon of ſin, title of inheritance to all good things, favour with God, grace to ſerve him, a fatherly care for him; yea, and to ſpare, he hath joyes, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, raviſhing of ſoul; he may, not only feed, but feaſt it by faith on Jeſus Chriſt: If you ſay, what is all this to me, who have no lot or ſhare in this matter? I anſwer, it is this to thee, it ſhould encourage thee to hope, and not utterly to deſpare of finding mercy; and from hence to animate thy ſoul to go to God, and wait upon him for it, to ſeek him diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the uſe of means; and to reſolve not to ſit ſtill &amp; dy of the famine ſilently, but to make thy moan to God, and pour out thy complaint before him; to ariſe and leave this far country where there is nothing but famine and death, and, with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> take up a reſolution to return to God, and ask gracious entertainment with him for a poor dying periſhing ſinner, who is he alone with whom <hi>the fatherleſs find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy.</hi>

                  <q>I will ariſe, and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned against heaven, and before thee.</q>

               <p>IN the former <hi>verſe</hi> we had the <hi>Prodigal</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and encouraging himſelf to return to his father, which is the firſt part of his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>2. In theſe words is ſet down his deliberate concluſion, or conſultation and determination what improvment to make of theſe arguments, which is, in ſumme to make proof of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love in the moſt penitent and humble manner. More particularly, he reſolves upon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108954:105"/> two things: 1. That he will return to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father.</hi> 2. How he will demean himſelf when he comes to him, <hi>viz.</hi> in the moſt ſubmiſſive and ſelf abaſing manner that is poſſible, and this appears, both in his confeſſion and petition. 1. In his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in which he acknowledgeth, 1. His ſin, aggravated in two things. 1. The object againſt whom, <hi>againſt heaven.</hi> 2. The preſence in which, <hi>before thee.</hi> 2. The merit or deſert of his ſin, <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy ſon.</hi> 2. His petition, ſubmitting to his fathers diſpoſal, <hi>Make me as one of thy hyred ſervants.</hi> Before I enter upon particulars, it will be needful to enquire, to what head in Divinity this is to be referred; whither to a preparatory or to a ſaving work: and I ſuppoſe it may be made evident that it refers to a ſaving work, and that true converſion is here deciphered, and ſet forth in theſe and the following words, <hi>verſe,</hi> 20. begin.</p>
               <p>It is true we have in theſe words only his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate purpoſe expreſſed; but we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the will is the firſt ſubject of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and when that is truly turned to God, there is a ſaving work wrought, and the whole man will follow, and ſo it did in this, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20 he hath now renounced his far Country and made choice of God. The work here deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Repentance, but not a ſeparate from, but
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108954:106"/> joyned with &amp; flowing from ſaving faith: for it was the ſpirit of Grace working faith in him, and acting of it who made him to draw this concluſion from the premiſes; that enabled him to adventure his ſoul upon God, and withal taught him how to do it in a penitent manner.</p>
               <p>Hence thoſe that place true Repentance in order before Faith, miſtake: Though Faith uſually firſt diſcovers it ſelf to us in act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the comforts of it are ſenſibly felt after Repentance; yea, the greateſt and nobleſt actings of faith are thoſe that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Repentance; leading the ſoul in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe of ſin and unworthineſs, to adventure it ſelf upon the mercy and power of a juſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, in returning to him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we are not to think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this reſolution is aſcribed to the <hi>Prodigal</hi> as his act, therefore our Repentance prevents the Grace of God: Our Saviours deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to deſcribe converſion by its Author, but by its ſubject, and by the effects on the ſubject. If it be enquired whence Repentance comes, there are other Scriptures which point us to the Author; but if we ask how Repentance works, here we have it.</p>
               <p>But I come to look more particularly into the words, and here; if we conſider when and how the <hi>Prodigal</hi> came to draw up this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by referring it to the <hi>verſ.</hi> foregoing, we
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108954:106"/> ſhall find that it ariſeth from the diſcoveries made of his fathers fulneſs of benignity: whence we might obſerve this,</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCT. I.</hi> The goodneſs of God, is the great motive to true Repentance, <hi>Rom. 2. 4.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>God wins the ſoul to himſelf nextly, not by terrours, but his benignity. It is true, God prepares them to entertain his kindneſs, by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diſcoveries, that ſo he may make it the more welcome; but ſtill, theſe do but terrifie, amaze, make afraid; but this is that which wins the ſoul, breaks the heart, encourageth hope, and by this way the ſpirit worketh the ſoul to Repentance. Hence that, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> Thus may teach us that for Miniſters to preach nothing but terrours, or for poor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened ſouls to look upon nothing but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, is not the way to promote the work of the Goſpel, or converſion of Souls: This drives only to deſpair: All our Doctrines, and all our hopes, muſt center in the free Grace of God. But I come to the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt part of his reſolution is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: <hi>viz.</hi> that he will return to his father; <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father.</hi> In this the work of Repentance is generally, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively intimated, in which there is;</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:108954:107"/>1. The <hi>terminus â quo:</hi> the place from whence he came, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>farr Country:</hi> where he was, though not locally, yet ſpiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from God, far from him in heart and life; this is it he will leave:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>terminus ad quem:</hi> or whether he will go, <hi>to his father:</hi> How God may be ſaid to be his father, who is an unregenerate profligate ſinner: I here intend not to make particular enquiry; though it may poſſibly be intimated to us by this words, being ſo often uſed in the parable, that by vertue of the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, every Elect Perſon, in his greateſt degeneracy and Prodigality, is looked upon as a Child, choſen in Chriſt to the Adoption of Children: But it here mainly intends his going to God as a Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The form of Repentance it ſelf; <hi>I will ariſe, and go:</hi> Where is the beginning of that motion, <hi>I will ariſe,</hi> and the progreſs, <hi>and go?</hi> or the reſpect that it bears to both the termes; to the far country, <hi>I will ariſe, i. e.</hi> I will ſit or tarry no longer here, I will leave it: to his father, <hi>I will go to him:</hi> In the Greek it is, <hi>riſing, I will go:</hi> And the word <hi>[riſe]</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies, <hi>riſing again: q. d.</hi> after ſome fall: and hence the nown is uſed for a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either from ſin, or from the grave: and becauſe this Anaſtaſie, preſumes a former Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, hence,</p>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:108954:108"/>1. Riſing implyes theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Riſing being an Anaſtaſie, implyes the ſinner before converſion to be in a ſtate of Apoſtaſie, or a fallen ſtate: it ſpeakes that man was once in a good ſtate, but now hath Ioſt it: God therefore uſeth this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to quicken them to Repentance, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 1. Thou haſt fallen by thine iniquity.</hi> A man that never was up may riſe; but he was once ſtanding that riſeth again: God made man upright, in our firſt Parents we once had a ſtanding in God's favour, but have loſt it by Sin, and now the whole race of mankind, till Grace raiſeth them, ly groveling in iniquity; nay, they are dead in Sin, for this riſing is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. And this ſhews that it is not a man's own ſtrength, but the Almighty power of God that giveth Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It implyes that in order to true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the ſoul muſt be furniſhed with a new principle of ſpiritual life: Self-motion, ſuch as riſing is, is a life act, and ſuppoſeth a life habit: It is the property of dead things to ly ſtill and move no further then they are forcibly moved; they are only living things that move by a power implanted in them: It therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes that the Spirit of God hath been at work, moving upon the dead ſoul, and breathing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it the breath of life: our Saviour ſaith, <hi>it is the ſpirit that quickeneth:</hi> He gives life to dry
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108954:108"/> bones, and then they riſe and walk, elſe they had never forgone their Graves: A dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs cannot ſo much as will to ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It implyes that in true Repentance there muſt be a forſaking of all Sin: we muſt not ly in Sin, if we will return to God: thoſe are directly oppoſite terms, Sin and God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traties; the <hi>farr Country</hi> in which the <hi>Prodigal</hi> was, is the Kingdom of Sin, which he muſt leave, elſe he can never come to his father; nor can a ſinner ever come to God, till he hath rejected and abandoned his ſinful life and way: Hence that counſel, <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Let the wicked forſake his way.</hi> There is no ſalvation to be had by ſitting ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Going to his father implyes theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every natural man, in his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, is at a great diſtance from God: Sin is therefore ſaid to make a <hi>ſeparation, Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. This means not a local diſtance, for Gods Omnipreſence fills all places, and is with the ſinner to eye and obſerve diligently all his wayes: but it intends a diſtance in heart and affection, an alienation; that God and the ſinner are enemies; he hates God's law and wayes, as God hates his way and courſe; God is therefore ſaid to <hi>ſee the proud afar off, Pſal.</hi> 178. 6. And the ſinner is ſaid to be <hi>far from God,</hi> Pſal. 73. 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in Repentance it is not enough to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108954:109"/> leave off ſinful wayes and courſes, but we muſt alſo put holineſs in practice: riſing out of ſin is neither true nor ſufficient, except there be returning unto God, hence they are both put together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 7. This is but like the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee's</hi> negatives which could not declare him juſtified: we muſt not only <hi>ceaſe to do evil,</hi> but we muſt alſo <hi>learn to do well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God alone is the object of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: <hi>He goes to his father.</hi> It is vain for an awakened ſinner to go any where elſe,; it is but to <hi>wander from mountain to hill,</hi> from one vanity to another; hence that reſtriction, <hi>Jer. 4. 1. If thou wilt return, return to me.</hi> The diſtreſſed ſoul is full of projects, and would try many concluſions, but the repenting Believer is reſolved in this, that he will go to God, and no whither elſe, <hi>Jer. 3. 23. Joh. 6. 68.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in the work of converſion, there is not only a paſſive reception of grace, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an actual improvment of it unto active Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If God gives us life we muſt ſtir; if he gives us legs we muſt go, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. God ſo calls a ſinner in converſion, as that he makes him anſwer his call, <hi>riſe and come away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the nature of ſaving faith, which is a truſting in God for life: Now ſuch truſt of theſoul neceſſarily requires repentance in both parts of it: for, if God be truſted in,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108954:109"/> all other truſt muſt needs be forſaken and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: to dwel by Ciſterns argues the fountain is relinquiſhed: He that will <hi>find mercy,</hi> muſt ſay <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave;</hi> and if God be truſted in for life, then the ſoul muſt needs go to him for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. Faith without exerciſe is dead, and the working of faith and love is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Repentance, as without faith there is no ſalvation, ſo faith cannot be, but it will bring forth fruit in Repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe, as happineſs and miſery are contraries, ſo the way to the one and the other muſt be contrary: Now the way in which man brought himſelf into miſery was by departing from God and falling into Sin. The Prophet deſcribes it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 13. and aslong as the cauſe of miſery remains, the continuance of it muſt be: As long as a ſinner lyeth in Sin, he muſt needs be miſerable: the foundation of happineſs is laid in ſaving us from Sin, <hi>Mat. 1. 12. He ſhall ſave his People from their ſins.</hi> And therefore the way to Salvation muſt be retrograde: <hi>i. e.</hi> by riſing from Sin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to God. Man's felicity conſiſts in his enjoyment of God; he cannot enjoy him till he comes to him; every diſtance from God is a miſery: Sin is contrary to God, he therefore cannot in that ſenſe come to us, his holineſs forbids. Chriſt doth not ſave us <hi>in our ſins,</hi> but <hi>from our ſins,</hi> and that is by working
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108954:110"/> us to a true and and through Repentance: a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt become holy, elſe he <hi>cannot ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. To teach us that it exceeds the power of a natural man to effect his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or bring about his own ſalvation. Man by nature is <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> and is it poſſible that a dead man ſhould riſe and go by his own ſtrength, till a vital principle be put into him? as well might <hi>Lazarus,</hi> dead and ready to ſtink, have by his own vertue ſhaken off his grave cloths, and come forth without a Divine word, as the ſinner, fallen and dead in ſin, riſe and return to God: this is an act of ſpiritual life and requires a principle of it, and that can proceed from no leſs power than Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency: <hi>Paul</hi> therefore compares it with the work of Creation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and with the power of Reſurrection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. 20. It is true, it is the man that <hi>riſeth,</hi> and <hi>goeth;</hi> the act of Repentance proceeds formally from the Believer; but it is God by his Spirit that enforms him with this power and grace, whereby he is enabled to do it. Hence alſo we ſee how ineffectual means of themſelves muſt needs be, unleſs they be influenced by the ſpirit of grace: how vainly do they dream who attribute to man a power of converting himſelf, and put a Divine honour upon Moral ſwaſion, as if it could of it ſelf attract and draw
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108954:110"/> the heart after it? No, though God require means and ordinances, yet they are but the ſtaff of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and except the Lord God be there, the touch awakens not the dead man. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt <hi>propheſie over the dry bones,</hi> but it is the <hi>ſpirit that moves to bring them together, and puts life into them.</hi> Let no man then aſcribe this to himſelf; it may be thou knoweſt not how this wind blew, or how this babe of grace was formed; no more doth the Child how it was begotten and formed in the womb: but if you find the effect, that you are enabled to ariſe and go to your heavenly father, you muſt ſay the ſinger of God was here, and aſcribe all the glory of it to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. This diſcovereth their vain and preſumptuous hopes, who live and ly in ſin, and yet expect to be ſaved: and yet there are a great many of theſe; they boaſt of their hopes, and yet tarry in their far country, live among the ſwine, and feed upon husks, they are far from God, and will not return to him by Repentance; they hold their vain courſes, and approve not of the wayes of holineſs; theſe certainly forſake their own mercies, and will be found among the dead and not among the living: had not the <hi>Prodigal</hi> reſolved to riſe and return, he had periſhed, and ſo muſt all theſe, <hi>Pſal. 73. 27. They that are far from thee, ſhall periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:108954:111"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. For Examination; it may put us upon it by this Rule to try our hopes of Salvation, whither they be rightly grounded, and hopes that ſhall not periſh: Thou art by nature a Child of wrath; thou haſt been a poor <hi>Prodigal,</hi> haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, and in this ſtate there is nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to be expected, <hi>Rom. 3. 16. Destruction and miſery are in all their wayes.</hi> In God only is help, and that is only to be had in going to him, and thou canſt not go to him, except thou riſeſt and forſakeſt thy vain and carnal truſt in lying vanities: Where art thou? what haſt thou done? art thou purſuing lies? art thou ſitting ſtill and deſpairing? or art thou going upon thy return to God? art thou yet deliberating, or art thou reſolved? art thou conſulting with fleſh and blood? or haſt thou ſaid reſolutely I will ariſe and go to my father? If thou art in the full purpoſe of thy heart ſet againſt ſin, and for the glory of God, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his grace ſo to do, it is well; this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and he that gives to will, will alſo give to do: But if it be not ſo, what is thy hope built upon? what are thy comforts but deluſions? what are thy aſſurances but undoing deceit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 4. For Exhortation; and let me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it particularly to ſuch as, being under the ſenſe of periſhing in themſelves, have made
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108954:111"/> diſcovery of the great power and goodneſs of God, and received ſome preparatory hope by it; he hence encouraged and counſelled to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and go to God:</hi> Do you feel your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a condition ſo miſerable, and have you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered an object ſo glorious and ſutable? take heart, and reſolve to adventure into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and throw your ſelves upon him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, God therefore reveals himſelf to be ſuch an one to ſuch as you are, to this very end that you may be wooed and won to him; and if now you put him away by unbelief, you will ſlight Mercy. Remember withal, though there be ſo much ſupply with God, as is enough to make you compleatly happy, and to ſpare, yet it is only for comers: If you will taſte of this Feaſt you muſt accept of the invitation, and come and be ghueſts; you muſt come out of thoſe hedge-rows, and high-wayes in which you ly ſtarving, you muſt <hi>go to the waters, if you will have wine and milk, Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. Halt no longer between two opinions; if it be good periſhing, ſit ſtill, but if it be good to be ſaved ariſe and come away; come to a reſolution, draw up your concluſion. If you object and ſay, I can reſolve nothing of my ſelf, except God put his Grace and reſolution in me; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is true, but remember alſo, that as God is a free Agent, ſo we are obliged by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the ty of it is ſuch, that we muſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108954:112"/> we will bring guilt upon our ſelves, ſet about it; and this is our duty, to believe, and reſolve, not in your ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of God; nay, it is one of Satans cheats, to tell us we muſt wait before we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, till we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Grace coming in, whereas the habits of Grace come in undiſcerned, and the firſt fruit of Grace is to be found in the reſolution it ſelf: If God helps us to this reſolution, we muſt by that know that his Spirit is come into us; and it is our duty, in the uſe of means to ſtirr up our ſelves to believe. Reſolve then in the ſtrength of God; here thou art periſhing, <hi>there is mercy with him that he may be feared:</hi> he ſaith, if thou comeſt he will not upbraid thee: he ſaith, <hi>The hungry he will ſatisfie with bread,</hi> and give the longing ſoul the deſires of his heart: he ſaith, <hi>he will give the weary reſt;</hi> in a word, if ever you obtain Salvation it muſt be with him; hills, mountains, all created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will not afford it: Thou haſt tyred thy ſelf to no purpoſe in ſeeking it there already, and why ſhouldeſt thou again make a vain eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay? if God will he can; and he is a merciful God; the fatherleſs have found him ſo: Do thou but reſolve to leave all for him, and make choice of him for thy truſt, and he will do it for thee, what ever it be that thou wanteſt, grace, glory, and every good thing will he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon thee.</p>

               <p>THus of the <hi>Prodigals</hi> reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</p>
               <p>2. His purpoſe how to demean himſelf on his return follows to be conſidered: in which are ſhadowed out to us divers neceſſary conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of true Repentance, or qualifications wherein the truth of it doth appear; and ſerve to inſtruct us in the true and genuine working of ſaving Grace, to the humbling of the ſoul, and rendring him vile in his own eyes: And this is in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and his <hi>Petition:</hi> In the one he makes himſelf as bad as he can be, as little, as low, and ſinful; in the other he yields himſelf to be what ever his father would make him. To begin with the firſt:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his confeſſion he acknowledgeth his ſin, and the merit of it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the acknowledgment of his ſin: 1. He makes it his own, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> 2. He aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108954:113"/> it, 1. By the object againſt whom, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven:</hi> 2. By the preſence in which, <hi>before thee.</hi> The phraſe <hi>[againſt heaven]</hi> means againſt God himſelf: the word, <hi>Heaven</hi> is uſed both by <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> writers for God, either as one of his names, or elſe <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically,</hi> becauſe heaven is the place where he moſt gloriouſly appears. Divers uſeful truths may hence be gathered; I ſhall draw them all up into this one.</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. <hi>Where God gives true Repentance, ſuch an one will confeſs his ſins with the greateſt aggravation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>He will not mince or extenuate, and go about to make them look little and ſmall, but acknowledge them in their height &amp; greatneſs; preſent them in their blackeſt and uglieſt colours: ſo doth this <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſon reſolve to go to his father, and ſo did.</p>
                  <p>Though every ſin in its proper nature nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conſidered, as it is a Tranſgreſſion of the Laws of God, an affront offered, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given to the Majeſty of Heaven, is on that account great; yet there are ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with which it is clothed, which, if truly looked upon, do exaggerate or heighten the vileneſs of it: theſe the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to cover over, and hopes thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108954:113"/> himſelf <hi>â tanto,</hi> as the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> I am not thus and ſo: but contrariwiſe, in ſound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when the ſinner comes to humble himſelf before God, and confeſs his ſins, he makes himſelf as vile as he can: Sin is made exceeding ſinful. An hypocrite hopes to plead that he hath not been ſo bad, therefore he may hope for mercy; but <hi>Paul</hi> was of another mind, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 25. Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> And <hi>David, Pſal. 25. 11. Pardon mine iniquity, for it is very great.</hi> Now the aggravations in our <hi>text</hi> are three, under which heads the moſt that can be ſaid may be ranked; theſe let us a little look into.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He takes the whole blame upon himſelf: <hi>I have ſinned;</hi> it is I have done this thing; ſo <hi>David</hi> calls it his own ſin, <hi>Pſal. 51. 9. q. d.</hi> Whatever blame or guilt there is in it, I take it all to my ſelf: He confeſſeth it roundly, and plainly, without any excuſe, or extenuations, or putting it off to any other cauſe, occaſion, or tempter. And this is one difference between the repentance of an hypocrite and a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; the one would put off his ſin as much as he can, ſeek excuſes, find others to lay it upon, and bear as little of the blame as poſſibly he may; he would divide the fault, that he may leave the leaſt part of it to himſelf; and he finds many occaſions, or cauſes to change it upon.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:108954:114"/>1. He throwes it upon everlaſting decrees, and would make the holy counſel of God to have a cauſal influence into his wickedneſs; and will ſay, if God had intended me ſo to have been, I ſhould have been as holy as the Angels, but if he purpoſed me to be ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, how could I help it? Such the Apoſtle confronts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19. Thus Hypocrites, like Spiders, ſuck poyſon out of the precious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of predeſtination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He will charge God himſelf for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Temptations: will ſay, Divine all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficiency is the firſt mover, and if he had not aſſiſted, I had not committed the ſin: He preſented the obiect or I had not followed, ſuch the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſets himſelf againſt, <hi>Jam. 1. 13, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, he will blame the very goodneſs and kindneſs of God to him, and a curſe, or at leaſt a reaſon of his ſin, and ſo God, in ſtead of being acknowledged for his favour, ſhall be upbraided: So <hi>Adam, Gen. 3. 12. The woman mhom thou gaveſt to be with me, &amp;c.</hi> God had given her for a meet help to him, he could not have done well without her, and yet if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this favour, God is charged for it; and why then did he beſtow her upon me?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He will turn it off upon thoſe that were his Tempters; they ſollicited me, perſwaded me, drew me in: Thus <hi>Adam</hi> layes the fault.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108954:114"/> upon the Woman, and ſhe upon the Serpent; and thus men are oft ready to ſay, I may thank ſuch an one, who drew me in, who would not let me alone, but followed me, and prevailed upon me with importunity; if it had not been for him, I had not drawn away.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He will excuſe and mince it with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive circumſtances, to make it look like a very little fault, as, 1. He did it ignorantly, he knew no ſin there was in it but thought that he had done well enough: Thus <hi>Saul</hi> excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf for ſacrificing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 11, 12. 2. He did but follow his natural inclination, it was, at worſt, but a trick of youth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It was no great matter, a thing of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and others frequently do the like. 4. He was provoked to it; yea, had many great provocations which bare him down. Theſe, and many the like excuſes, the corrupt heart of man is ready to frame: But when God ſets ſin home upon the ſoul with the right conception of it, he then layes the blame upon himſelf, and that with greateſt aggravation, in which,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He acquits God; layes it not in the leaſt to his charge, but declares him to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blameleſs: <hi>David</hi> takes his ſin to himſelf, that God may <hi>be righteous and juſtified, Pſal. 51. 4. q. d.</hi> I have nothing to accuſe God of, he is holy and righteous.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:108954:115"/>2. He looks not too much upon inſtruments and occaſions; he layes not his own blame to another; doth not charge it as Satans fault, that he yielded to the Temptation, but counts it his own; <hi>Peter</hi> blames <hi>Ananias,</hi> that <hi>Satan had tempted him, Deut.</hi> 5. 3. It was Satan's fault to tempt, but his to be tempted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chargeth it upon his own vile heart and nature, that fountain and original of all actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tranſgreſſion: he is therefore led up to it, and made to bewail that before God, as the root of all, <hi>Pſal. 51. 5. I was ſhapen in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. q. d.</hi> Hence comes all this, here it is fountained; thus the <hi>Prodigal, Father, I have ſinned,</hi> I askt my Portion, and was not content till I had it in mine own hands; I took it and went away into a far Country, and waſted all there in riot,; I diſhonoured my original by becoming a ſlave to a ſtranger, keeping ſwine, and feeding with them upon husks: I did all thus voluntarily without any compulſion; I did it againſt the law of nature, and bond of filial obedience; he doth not ſay, it was a trick of youth, and theſe good follows, pot compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, gameſters and harlots, drew me in, and ſo I did it. The truly, penitent, ſo ſees his own guilt and wilful obſtinacy, that he can look no where elſe: what ever his occaſions or temptations were, yet ſtill he ſees that the Law of God was againſt it, which he ought
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108954:115"/> to have hearkened to notwithſtanding all Temptation; and his heart was in it, elſe they could never have prevailed; he gave his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or elſe it had never been.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He aggravates it in that it was againſt God. <hi>q. d.</hi> Had I only wronged a creature, it had not been ſo much, but this is it that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it hainous; it was <hi>againſt Heaven:</hi> All ſin is againſt God. Wrongs are valued according to the perſon wronged: A thing is counted Treaſon when done againſt a Prince, which would be a little fault if only done to a ſubject. It is remarkable, that in the Parable it ſelf, the younger Son is brought in acknowledging his ſin to be againſt Heaven, rather than againſt the Father: Nothing, that the wrongs we do to others are therein moſtly to be bewailed, in that they are againſt God. Hence <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it with an emphaſis, <hi>Pſal. 51. 4. Againſt thee, thee only.</hi> It was againſt <hi>Uriah,</hi> againſt <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> &amp;c. but that was little compared to, and therefore ſwallowed up in this. True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance runs ſin up to the laſt object againſt whom it is, now all ſin is againſt God in that it is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Againſt the Law of God; for that is it which makes it to be ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4. It is not the hurt which another receives, nor what we our ſelves ſuffer, but what we do, that firſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates it ſin; but it is the contrariety it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108954:116"/> bears to the precept, and holy revealed will of God: He that breaks thy King's Laws, wrongs the King himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Againſt the love of God; his good will, his bounty and beneficence to his creatures, by which he doth invite and engageth all men to ſerve and honour him; it is therefore called <hi>a deſpiſing of his goodneſs, Rom.</hi> 2. 4. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bounty made the Sons ſins the worſe, he had readily given him a plentiful Portion, and yet he ſpends it in riot.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againſt the promiſes and threatnings of God; they ſlight the one, and contemn the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are not in love with the promiſes, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of his wrath: There are great promiſes made to obedience, but they forſake theſe mercies, count them as worthleſs things: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 9, to 13. God hath fearfully menac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and denounced heavy judgments againſt ſin and ſinners, and bids them beware of ſin becauſe of them, <hi>Jer. 6. 8. Be inſtructed, leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi> And becauſe theſe are from God, who is able to honour his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to make inexpreſſibly miſerable his enemies, this is a ſore aggravation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Againſt God's earneſt and heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calls and counſels; yea, ſtrongeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and perſwaſions: What ſtronger plea can God uſe againſt ſin, than to declare that it is <hi>abominable</hi> to him, &amp; <hi>his ſoul hates it?</hi> yet it is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108954:116"/> a grief to his ſpirit, and will oppreſs him? and yet thus God pleads with ſinners, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againſt his Honour and Glory: There is nothing ſo much againſt the declarative glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God as ſin is; yea, nothing at all is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but ſin: Every ſin diſhonours his Name; by ſecret ſin we diſhonour him in our hearts, by open ſin, we do it in our lives: God is an holy God, and it is only holineſs that honours him. Now this is to ſee ſin ſinfull, when we are brought to ſee that it is againſt God, wherein properly the ſinfulneſs of it doth conſiſt: Nor can a ſoul ever know how great an evil ſin is, nor the meritoriouſneſs of it, nor the equity of the penalty threatned againſt it, till he be fully perſwaded and made to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is <hi>againſt Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He aggravates it, in that it was not only <hi>againſt,</hi> but <hi>before</hi> his father: Thus alſo <hi>David</hi> aggravates his ſin, <hi>Pſal. 51. 4. and done this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in thy ſight.</hi> The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the ſight: and Sin is committed in the preſence of God; he ſtands by &amp; look on; not only ſuch ſins as are committed in the ſight of ſun, but ſuch alſo as are done in the dark, &amp; out or the ſight of mortal men: he ſees into every corner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 12. Divine Omnipreſence fills all places: and this is a great aggravation of Sin; it argues either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Great heedleſneſs; that men do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108954:117"/> the preſence of God; and that ſhews much of Atheiſm: Did men know or believe that God ſtood by and over-looked all their actions, would they dare ſo to do as they do? This was that which made them ſo impudently bold, in <hi>Ezek. 9. 9. They ſay, the Lord ſeeth not.</hi> And thus men deny that glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute without which he were not God, Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Horrid prophaneneſs: If men do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and yet regard not that God ſeeth them, it argues that men have caſt off the fear of God from them, that they have loſt the aw of his Judgements, and are not afraid of his wrath. It is the aggravation of <hi>Sodoms</hi> Sin, <hi>Gen. 23. 13. They were ſinners before the Lord.</hi> God comes to men and preſents himſelf in his ſtrict commands, and ſevere threatnings, tells them in his Word and Ordinances that his wrath ſhall burn againſt ſuch Sins, and ſuch Sinners; and yet they care not: God ſpeaks by his Word, and ſpeaks by conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but to no purpoſe; this proves mens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon why God makes the true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent thus ſee and acknowledge Sin is not to drive the ſoul beyond hope of mercy, but it is.</p>
                  <p>I. To make the creature ſo touched with the ſenſe of his own ſin, that he may thus ſee it in its worſt colours, and thence learn to loath it,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108954:117"/> and himſelf for it: that he may ſee Sin hateful not only in its conſequents, but in its ſelf, and thence what reaſon God hath, and how juſt it is for him to be ſo ſevere, and bear ſuch a dreadful witneſs againſt Sin, as he doth in his word and works, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the greatneſs of the riches of his grace may appear, and be known to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable: that every believer may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the meaning of that, <hi>Rom. 5. 20. Where ſin hath abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall not only acknowledge grace, but with an emphaſis, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15, 16. The blacker the Sin looketh, the brighter will grace appear, and the more intenſe will the love of the ſoul be to God: It is our Saviours argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luk. 7. 47. To whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</hi> That believer that hath ſeen, and known the worſt of himſelf, ever hath the moſt precious thoughts of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. Here we ſee how far thoſe are from true Repentance, who inſtead of aggravating, do mince and extenuate their Sins, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them look as ſmall as they can, that they may be little affected with, or humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for them. Many pretend they have come to God, and believed in him, but how did they come? Why, as the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> with their proud boaſtings, not as the <hi>Publican,</hi> with <hi>a Lord have mercy on me a ſinner.</hi> They have looked for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108954:118"/> Grace and Mercy, not on the account of Chriſt alone, but their encouragement hath been, they have been better than others, have good a nature, have not been tainted with ſuch Sins, nor ſo diſhonoured God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not the way of Goſpel-Repentance; ſuch as theſe are far from true converſion; there is yet a great work to do for and upon them if ever they come to be made ſharers of ſaving mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. This may ſerve to anſwer that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual objection or diſcouragement which many awakened ſinners are exerciſed withal, and deterred by, from coming to Chriſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the greatneſs of their ſins, their hainouſneſs, their amazing aggravations, they have not finned at the ordinary rate, but exceeded, and none have ſinned like them; they have gotten to ſpeak terribly againſt themſelves: and hence they are ready to draw a deſperate concluſion, <hi>there is no hope for me:</hi> This you ſee directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Goſpel method; whereas you ought thus to argue, therefore there is the greateſt need for me above all: Let thoſe that think their wounds ſmall, that hope to cure them themſelves, or to out-grow them, let ſuch tarry away; but for me, I muſt periſh if I go not to the Phyſitian; yea, this may animate you to this, to conſider, this is the way of Chriſt; he makes <hi>ſin very bitter, Jer.</hi> 2. 19. Where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to afford his grace and ſalvation; and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108954:118"/> till you find it to be ſo, you are not fit for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: there is no plea for mercy more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to or prevalent with Chriſt, than that which is framed from the ſenſible acknowledgement, of its Sin in its greateſt aggravations: The worſe we count of our ſelves, the better he likes us, and the fitter we are for his grace to work upon; let this then drive thee the more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. From counſel to ſuch as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the hopes of mercy, and would go to God for it, how to go ſo as to find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſumme, labour to be as vile in your own eye and eſteem as can be: get the deep ſenſe and apprehenſion of the greatneſs of your ſin: charge Sin as God chargeth it, aggravate Sin as the word of God aggravates it; judge your ſelves by the righteous law of God; feel the weight and burden of Sin, and groan under it as thoſe that are weary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with it; ſuch are encouraged, <hi>Matt. 11. 28. Come to me ye that are weary and heavy laden.</hi> Add every proper weight to Sin that may make it the moſt burdenſome and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portible thing in the world: In particular;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Make it your own, and take the blame to your ſelves, Sin ever affects us more or leſs, according as we find our ſelves intereſted in it, ſo much as we fault others, ſo much of ſelf Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification will follow; and the leſs we have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108954:119"/> known Sin to be our own, the leſs will the grace of Chriſt be ſweetned in our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: When <hi>Cicero</hi> would ſet forth <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s great clemency, he makes his own fault every way his own: <hi>Nullâ vi coactus, judicio meo, &amp; voluntate meâ, ad ea arma profectus ſum, quae ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſunt contra te. Pro Ligar.</hi> Thus muſt you do, and thus ſhall you bring glory to pardoning mercy; See and ſay, it was your own choice, your heart was in it, you were not compelled, but acted freely, reſolutely, and therefore have juſtly deſerved to be rejected when you have nothing to plead for your ſelves, then you are fit to plead mercy. Remember therefore that <hi>God made man upright, it is he that hath ſought out many inventions.</hi> God hath given to no tempters, either Men or Devils, power over your wills to compel them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See how vile your Sin muſt be, in that it hath been againſt God: you never look aright upon it until you bring it up hither. It is true, Sin cannot rob God of his eſſential glory, which is out of the reach of the creatures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, but his declarative glory is thereby abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: you have not only wronged man that is a worm, but you have injured the God of Glory: It is his holy Law that you have broken, elſe it is not Sin; you have preferred a baſe luſt, a lying vanity before him; you have rejected the rule of infinit wiſdom, which only can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108954:119"/> man to his end: you have deſpiſed and trampled upon the great reward of happineſs, which was propounded to you: you have caſt off the yoke of ſupream ſoveraignty, under which you ought to have put your ſelves: You have placed Sin in God's Throne, and given it the precedency; you have ſlighted the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and precious invitations of the Goſpel, which have been ſet before you; you that are worms of the duſt, have riſen up againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty: And is not this a ſore and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing? Can you be too much affected for that Sin which is of ſo deep a dye? this is the true and kindly ſence which every penitent Soul, enlightned by the Spirit of Grace, hath of his Sins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How bold muſt that Sin needs be, which hath been committed before the face and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Would you not have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid and aſhamed, if ſinful men like your ſelves had ſtood by and looked on when you committed theſe and thoſe Sins? how then were you not afraid to do them when God looked on? if you did not conſider it, was not that an Atheiſtical Spirit? or, if you cared not for, nor regarded it, was it not a brazen face? you were not afraid of his terrors, nor awed with his judgments, you either forgat God, which is deſperate ſecurity, or you deſpiſed him which is high Prophaneneſs; Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108954:120"/> your Sins to God, if you hope to find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: hide not, cover them not under your tongues, be not afraid to make the worſt of them; you cannot confeſs worſe than God knows: judge your ſelves if you would not be judged of the Lord: if you now hide your Sins, God will unmask them before Angels and Men; but if you thus confeſs, God is juſt to forgive. Be not afraid to confeſs your ſelves the chief of Sinners; this cannot ſet you beyond the hope of mercy, ſince Chriſt is more able to ſave, than we are to deſtroy our ſelves, ſince it is before a God who can <hi>abundantly pardon;</hi> ſince Chriſts buſineſs is to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, labour to know and confeſs your ſelves to be really and truly ſo: and the more you know and feel your ſelves to be ſuch, the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement you have to go to Chriſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Sin hath taken away all other Pleas from fallen man, and left no room for him to ſay any thing more or other, for, or of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that he hath ſinned, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf to wrath, and hath no other thing to fly to, but the Grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus; on which account it is that he hath this one plea left him humbly to preſent. <hi>For thy Name ſake, O Lord! pardon my iniquity, for it is very great.</hi>

                  <p>The Grace we are here conſidering of is true Humility, a fruit and diſcovery of Faith, and concomitant of ſound Repentance. You ſhall ſee that our Saviour finds and acknowledgeth true and great Faith in it, <hi>Mat. 8. 8. with</hi> 10. It is a Grace which God requires and earneſtly calls for in Scripture, and is made the end of many ſolemn diſpenſations of God to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16. now this Humility hath two things in it: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A low and vile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of one ſelf. 2. Which follows, a yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſelf up to Gods diſpoſe: the former we have now to conſider; the latter follows in the next words: This firſt is an utter renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of ſelf-excellence. Man by nature is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proud, he thinks himſelf to be of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and worth; hence he counts all the evil that befals him, an injury, and all good, a debt: the Soul is not fit for Chriſt, but God, when he draws him home to himſelf, makes him know that he is the moſt worthleſs creature in the World to receive any good, and worthy of all evil. And that we may make ſome particular diſcovery of this Grace, we may conſider it in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The root of it. 2. The fruit proceeding from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The root of this Humility, and that which influenceth each part of it, is a deep ſenſe and apprehenſion of his own vileneſs. The Spirit of God gives him to ſee, find and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108954:121"/> feel himſelf to be a vile creature: this is <hi>Job</hi>'s Confeſſion, <hi>Job 40. 4. I am vile,</hi> the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies contemptible, or worthy of no eſteem: he finds and confeſſeth himſelf every way vile.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vile as he is a Man, a piece of Clay, a little duſt of the Ballance. God made man ſo as that he might ever ſee cauſe to have low and little thoughts of himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. his body a lump of dirt, his breath a blaſt, himſelf a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of worms: God muſt ſtoop to take notice of man in his greateſt excellency; hence the Pſalmiſt thinks of it with admiration, <hi>Pſal. 8. 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much more, becauſe he is a ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the ſence and apprehenſion of his own Sin, renders him unſpeakably abominable in his own eyes: he ſees Sin to be a vile thing, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being a Sinner, to be defiled with it. Sin is not only vile in it ſelf, but it renders every one ſo that is polluted by it: the beſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are vile, if compared with God, but ſinful Man much more, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 14, 15, 16. this hath rendred Man loathſome to God, whoſe pure eye hates Sin; and ſhall render him ſo to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when God ſhall do him good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31. this hath pulled off his Scarlet, and thrown him upon a Dung hill: this hath defaced his beauty, and covered him with deformity; degraded his Glory, and filled him with Ignominy; yea,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108954:122"/> overſpread him with <hi>wounds, ulcers, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſores;</hi> ſo that now he can ſee nothing in himſelf that might attract love, but juſtly cauſe loathing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Vile in all that he doth: Such as is the principle, ſuch are the acts: <hi>Like tree, like fruits, Mat.</hi> 7. 16. ſee <hi>Job</hi> 14. 4. If he look on none but his beſt actions that he doth, yet here he ſeeth his own filthineſs ſo deriving it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that he cannot place any eſteem up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but declare them vile things, <hi>Iſa. 64 6. Filthy rags.</hi> Filthy; the word is variouſly tranſlated, and by all to ſet out loathſome vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The like you have of <hi>Paul, Phil. 3. 8. dung.</hi> The truly humbled ſoul ſees no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in himſelf, which he can call his own, nor any thing done by him which is not pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. 18. In my fleſh dwells no good thing.</hi> So that he dares not put his actions upon the tryal, but deprecates it, as <hi>David, Pſal. 14. 3. 2. Enter not into Judgment with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. This is the root of Humility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fruit that proceeds from this root, is the debafing of him in his own eſteem, and firſtly, the ſenſible acknowledging his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of mercy, and defect of miſery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His unworthineſs of any mercy: the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal</hi> confeſſeth that he deſerveth no kindneſs from his father; ſo doth the truly humbled ſoul ſee that he deſerves nothing at the hands of God. In particular.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:108954:122"/>1. He acknowledgeth that he is unworthy of the leaſt outward mercy, ſo far from being worthy to be treated as a ſon, as not to deſerve to be treated as a creature: and here he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he is unworthy of his life, that he is a <hi>Child of wrath by nature,</hi> and doth not deſerve that God ſhould ſuffer him to breath in his world, it is a great kindneſs that he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and deſtroyed from off the face of the earth, and turned down into the pit long before this, <hi>Lum.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he is unworthy of livelyhood: he cannot challenge, as a debt from God, ſo much as the leaſt bit of bread, or draught of water, but if he do beſtow it upon him, it is a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending favour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unworthy that God ſhould conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſtep aſide to do him the leaſt courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſie at all; that he ſhould viſit him with any mercy, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8. 8. Hence he wonders at all, ſaith, as <hi>David, Who am I?</hi> or as <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, 2 Sam. 9. 8. What is thy ſervant, that that thou ſhouldeſt look upon ſuch a dead dog as I am?</hi> The ungrateful ſinner is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with God, let him ſhew him never ſo much kindneſs; but the humble ſinner won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at God, let him ſhew him never ſo

                  <p n="2">2. He acknowledgeth that he is much more unworthy that God ſhould pardon his Sin, and take him among the number of his Children, that he ſhould relieve his famiſhing Soul, and beſtow his Grace upon him: it is ſuch a thing that he dareth hardly ſpeak of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 14. when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his calling to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, how doth he ſet it forth? ſee <hi>Eph. 3. 18. To me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints:</hi> how much more may every one ſay ſo of his Converſion? he will acknowledge, that if God refuſe to come and ſave him, he doth him no wrong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19, 20. if he do it, it is meer Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He acknowledgeth his worthineſs of all miſery: that he is not only undeſerving, but ill-deſerving; that he hath not only forfeited all mercies, but procured to himſelf all woes; is not only unprofitable, but is alſo a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to God. In particular,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He acknowledgeth that all the ſorrows and ſufferings of this life, are not only his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, but <hi>leſs than his deſert,</hi> Ezra 9. 13. <hi>Job</hi> 11. 6 He will not only juſtifie Gods anger, but mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifie his mercy in all the ſorrows that befal him here in this World, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. if God take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:108954:123"/> 
                     <hi>God, but bleſſeth him,</hi> Job 1. 20, 21, 22. the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God are juſt, his executions of them righteous, and his moderation of them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the utmoſt of the wrath and curſe of God is duly and truly his merit: that he hath done things worthy of Death, and that it belongs to him as his wages, <hi>Rom. 8. ult.</hi> Dan. 9. 8. he ſees Hell to be a place proper for him, and confeſſeth that it is mere patience that hath hitherto kept him out of it, elſe he had been there ere this: he ſees weight enough in his Sin to ſink him down into the nethermoſt Hell, and that he is not there as well as others, undergoing endleſs, eaſeleſs, remedileſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not becauſe he is better, but becauſe God is more merciful to him.</p>
                  <p>Now when the humbled Soul is thus made ſenſible of his own worthleſsneſs, hereupon theſe further fruits of it diſcover themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is really taken off from all confidence in himſelf: he now dares to reſt no longer upon any thing that is his, whether of nature or grace, to give him favour with God, and plead for him in his preſence. He now dares not to rely upon his duties, though done with never ſo much ſeriouſneſs and ſincerity; no, they are <hi>Loſs, Dung, Rags</hi> to him; they are not to be truſted in, or accounted of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is taken off from exalting himſelf,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108954:124"/> and his own duties: all ſelf-conceits are beaten down; and his buſineſs is to undermine them, and undervalue them; <hi>he denies himſelf,</hi> this is true humility, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. He deſpiſeth his own ſervices, they are nothing, nor is he ever the more worthy for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He comes before God with ſelf-abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: comes not as a proud man, that thinks he comes for nothing but what he may expect and challenge, and it will be an affront to deny it him, as they did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 3. No, but he layes all his excellencies, and all his moralities, and all his good duties in the duſt, under God's feet, and acknowledgeth that he may, if he ſees meet, trample upon them, and do him no wrong, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 6. If he had thought a thought or ſpoken a word in defence of his own worth or deſerving, he loaths himſelf for that word or thought; he eats it again, and profeſſeth he will ſpeak no more, and condemns himſelf for what he hath ſpoken already.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſon why God works this grace in converſion, is becauſe his great deſign in the New-Covenant, is to bring about man's Salvation in a way of Grace, the Glory of which Attribute is the bottom end of his counſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. Now then grace appears to be grace, in reſpect of the ſubject, it is applyed to, when this ſubject is made to appear the moſt undeſerving; and every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108954:124"/> lowering the creatures deſert, heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the excellency of this Grace: Hence you ſhall find the Scripture loves to ſet it oft with this, <hi>Deut. 26. 5. &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 16. begin. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 begin. And, inaſmuch as man is actively to give God the glory of this grace, it is therefore needful, that he ſee and feel in himſelf, that which may put the Emphaſis upon it: Thus the Apoſtles argument was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8. To ſee good, honeſt, innocent men taken to heaven, would be no ſuch great matter to be ſpoken of, but to ſee ſuch as had been wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had provoked God, were <hi>ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> &amp;c. ſaved, this is matter for heaven to ring of to all eternity: none will ſo wonder at their own ſalvation, as thoſe that have been deepeſt apprehenſive of, and humbled for their own ſinful unworthineſs of mercy, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God to wrath; they will glorifie God indeed, who ſee that he hath <hi>ſaved them from loweſt hell,</hi> in which he might have left them in chains, priſoners, to have ſuffered wrath for ever.</p>
                  <p>The more full application of this truth will fall under the following <hi>Doctrine;</hi> containing the other part of Goſpel humility, it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to hint at one here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE.</hi> To convince and perſwade poor fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their worthleſneſs: If ever you would come unto God acceptably, you muſt come
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108954:125"/> unto him empty of all ſelf-conceits, renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all worth or excellency in your ſelves: ſo long as you think you deſerve any thing ſo long Chriſt will refuſe you: He will have you to caſt your ſelves upon meer mercy, unto which you have no claim of your own, but ſue for it as beggars, who can no way oblige their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to do them a kindneſs. See then and view how unworthy you are that God ſhould do any thing for you; unworthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favours, much more unworthy to be called his Sons or Daughters: For motive, conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. None but the humble ſoul can expect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God: <hi>He ſees the proud afar off,</hi> but <hi>the humble he will exalt:</hi> When you ly low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, you are neareſt the height of happineſs: it is from the dungeon, from the loweſt pit, that Chriſt fetcheth thoſe whom he makes his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; it is the <hi>meek he will teach his way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. None but the humble ſoul takes a right ſcantling of himſelf: this man only is he that knows himſelf: and we can never know God aright in the Covenant of his Grace, till we have a right apprehenſion, of our ſelves. Now that you may clearly underſtand your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs. Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That you have never done any thing in all your lives, that can render you worthy in God's account: the Godly themſelves muſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108954:125"/> ſay of all they do, <hi>they are unprofitable, Luk.</hi> 17. 10. The beſt deeds of ſanctified men call for forgiveneſs; yea, for the merits of Chriſt to render them acceptable unto God, which makes them ſo far from boaſting, that it puts them upon it to ask forgiveneſs. According to the firſt Covenant, thoſe works were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy of acceptance and reward, whereby God was glorified in perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; wherein the heart and life were exactly conformed to the mind of the Law of God, that was given man for his rule; but ſince the fall, the beſt of men cannot thus do: And as for thee, thou haſt been a ſinner, how juſtly maiſt thou take that to thy ſelf, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet charged that wicked King withal? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5 23. Thou haſt kept no command of God, but fallen ſhort of all, and what worthineſs canſt thou plead? thoſe ſervices which thou thinkeſt thou haſt done, even they are worſe than <hi>filthy rags;</hi> for the Church concludes here to be no better, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How much thou haſt done to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy ſelf unworthy: Thou haſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done nothing for God and his Glory, but but haſt been doing very much againſt it; nay conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What an unworthy creature thou art in thy natural ſtate; ſo far from being amiable in Gods eyes, that thou art by nature a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108954:126"/> object: Thy pedegree, original, ſtate, all ſpeak all againſt thee: thou maiſt ſee what thou art, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. begin. Though thou hadſt done nothing againſt God, yet thy very being is hateful: Who counts toads and ſnakes worthy of preſervation, but rather of deſtruction?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou haſt carried it unworthily towards God in the whole courſe of thy life: all the dayes of thy vanity and unregeneracy, all thy courſe and carriage, hath been to ſet thee out of his favour. If vile and profligate abuſes will give a man worth, thou mighteſt claim it, for ſuch hath all thy life been. Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What God hath been doing for you: how many ways he hath been expreſſing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pitty, favour to you: The being he hath given you, the preſervation afforded to you, the proviſion he hath made for you, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath heaped upon you; but above all, the precious Salvation he hath ſet before you, and all the means given you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of it: innumerable have been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, ſtrong the cords that he hath laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What you have requited him with; in one word, Ingratitude <hi>(&amp; ſi ingratum dixeris, omnia dixiſti.)</hi> Nay, opprobrious contumity: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You have driven a trade of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108954:126"/> and provoking him all your lives long: it hath been your cuſtom from your youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nay, you have done it with delight; you have made nothing to break his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; yea, it hath been a ſport and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you, <hi>you could not ſleep without it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have abuſed and miſ-improved all his mercies, taking encouragment by them to ſin againſt him: with his own you have diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his great Name; <hi>with his flax, and his wool,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 8, 9. You have ſpent that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he lent you in riot, have made his creatures to ſerve your ſins, and ſo armed them againſt him, and thereby made the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to groan under your oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You have ſought for ſuccour, relief, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to other things, and not to him, have truſted in creatures and not in the Creator, you have lived upon husks, and fed on the air, and have made your ſelves ſervants; yea, ſlaves to Satan and the World, and thereby diſgraced your Original, and forgotten your end, which was to ſerve God, and depend upon him for all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You have deſpiſed his Redemption and Grace, that hath been tendered to you in the Goſpel: Jeſus Chriſt, that precious Saviour, hath been leſs eſteemed by you than your vile luſt, and filthy pleaſures; his patience hath been ſlighted, and grace refuſed; you have
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108954:127"/> turned a deaf ear to his counſel, the back and not the face to his proffers of Salvation; thus hath he been of no worth in your eyes. And now ſay, What are you worthy of? Ask your own Conſciences, and they will tell you, <hi>that you do ſuch things as are worthy of death:</hi> An heathen's Conſcience will ſay ſo much, <hi>Rom. 1. ult.</hi> You are worthy to have all thoſe mercies that you have thus abuſed, taken from you, and to be turned down into the place of woes and miſeries: Hell is a place fit for you, and the torments of it a due reward. Thus thou art unſpeakably unworthy that God ſhould ſhew thee any mercy: Get then to be deeply abaſed, and aſhamed of thy ſelf; hang down thy head with the Publican, and ſo go to the throne of Grace, and ask mercy of God for his own ſake, for Chriſt's ſake; this is the way in which God is to be found, and entertainment to be had with him: God is not wont to ſend ſuch away aſhamed, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>

               <p>2. VVE have heard of the <hi>Prodigals</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, now follows his petition: <hi>Make me as one of thy hyred ſervants.</hi> True hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility (as was hinted before) hath two things in it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A low eſteem of one-ſelf: 2. A yielding one-ſelf to God's diſpoſe, this latter is here preſented to us. The world is much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with this younger ſon; time was when the place and condition of a ſon in the family would not content him, but he muſt have his Portion and take his liberty; but now he would be glad ſo he might but fare as a ſervant in his Father's houſe. God, in the work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will hide pride from man, and make him very low. There is naturally a ſelf-ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in every Child of <hi>Adam;</hi> though beggars, they would yet be chuſers; and if they may not have their will, they will riſe up in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This God breaks him off from, whom he takes to himſelf. <hi>Make me, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. handle
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108954:128"/> me, treat me: <hi>as one of thy hyred ſervants:</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſervants are, 1. Members of the family. 2. The meaneſt ſort of members, except ſlaves. It intends two things. 1. The ſon deſires admiſſion into his fathers family, under his favour and care. 2. Submits to be diſpoſed of as he ſees meet, and will not repine, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a favour. Hence,</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. <hi>In true Converſion a ſinner is brought to a voluntary reſignation of himſelf to God's diſpoſe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>He voluntarily throws himſelf down at Gods feet, and leaves him to do with him as he ſees meet. This is the higheſt part of ſelf-denial, which Chriſt requires in thoſe that come unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. And this will follow upon a true ſight and ſenſe of our own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and both of theſe are rooted in the right apprehenſion of our own vileneſs. It will not be amiſs to look into the nature of this Grace, and its operation in an humble ſoul; and there is in it ſomthing Negative, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Poſitive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Negative part of it is, that he will be no longer at his own diſpoſe: He finds that he hath been ſo long enough already to his coſt: The <hi>Prodigal</hi> found that it was the taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf the Goverment of himſelf, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108954:128"/> brought him to all his miſery, and this taught him to ſee how unable he was to rule and guide himſelf. He hath no wiſdom, no diſcretion, but is a meer childiſh thing; hence reſolves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as they, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. He confeſſeth himſelf to be <hi>bruitiſh and ignorant;</hi> readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſents that <hi>it is not of man of himſelf to direct his own way,</hi> or make a good choice for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Poſitive part of it is, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God ſhould do with him as he ſeeth meet; to place and order him according to his wiſdom and pleaſure. But me thinks, in the very front of this diſcourſe, a great and puzling queſtion ſeems to aſſult us, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether in this part of Humiliation, God requires the ſouls to be ſo low as to be willing to be damned if he ſees meet? Some have been troubled about it, elſe I ſhould think the queſtion unneceſſary: But leſt any may think themſelves not humbled enough for want of this, I ſhall anſwer it, and I may ſafely lay it down as a poſitive aſſertion. <hi>That no man is bound to be willing to be damned.</hi> You ſee how the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> though he yields to his Father's wiſdom and will in diſpoſing of him, yet he begs for a place in his family, and be as one of the houſhold; he would be there where he may have bread and not famiſh. Thus ought every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to eſcape damnation; to uſe utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108954:129"/> in it, and to pray, and weep, and ſtrive againſt it: For.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A deſire after happineſs, and an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of miſery are naturally ſeated in a man by a concreated principle: Now ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as God put into man's nature in Creation, and ſtamped indelebly upon his being, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being obliterated, were therefore put in him to be helps to lead him right to his end for which he was made: &amp; therefore to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be damned, is a tranſgreſſion againſt the nature of man; it is a violence offered to his own being and inclinations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath made it the duty of all men to ſeek after, and uſe means to obtain happineſs: yea, all that duty which God hath laid upon men in the firſt and ſecond Covenant, it is with an eye and aim at happineſs: This is the motive in each to ſpur man on to his duty: God promiſed life to <hi>Adam</hi> if he obeyed, for life therefore was he to obey: and Chriſt alſo promiſeth ſalvation to him that believes, he is therefore to believe for ſalvation, or <hi>that he may be ſaved, 2 Theſ. 2. 10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Man was made to glorifie God: <hi>i. e.</hi> the end of the precept for which man was by du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obliged, was that he might ſerve, honour, and glorifie him: and having loſt this power by the fall, it is every mans duty to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter true Grace, whereby he may again pleaſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108954:129"/> God; for without this principle, we cannot do it, and where this principle is, it neceſſarily includes, or involves Salvation in it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſire to be converted, but we do withal deſire to be ſaved. We are to pray for Grace, without which we can do no ſervice for God: <hi>Now Eupraxy is happineſs formally;</hi> to be willing to be damned therefore, includes in it to be willing to be without Grace, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſhonouring God for ever, as the damned do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But no unregenerate man knowes whether he be Choſen to life, and he ought to be willing to be diſpoſed of according to Gods Decree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection labours of great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not God's Decrees but his Commands are the rules of mens actions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 29. It is not for us, in enquiring after our duty, ſo much as to propoſe what is decreed, what not: For though God hath made it a rule of his own works, yet he hath given us another of ours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No man can know whether he be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or no, till he can make his calling ſure, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 10. As for reprobation, there are no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infallible notes known to a man of it, nor doth God reveal the other but by drawing the ſoul effectually home to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:108954:130"/>3. The invitations of the Goſpel are to all where the ſound of it comes; and all ſuch are bound by the precepts to obey them, except they will bring guilt on themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 29.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men are not damned under the Goſpel becauſe they are reprobated, but becauſe they ſlight the Goſpel, and wilfully refuſe to accept of Chriſt and his Salvation, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is both lawful and a duty to pray for things that God hath never purpoſed to bring to paſs: <hi>Stephen</hi> elſe have ſinned in his laſt words, <hi>Act. 7. ult.</hi> Nor could we ever know whom to pray for, leſt we ſhould ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> If it be then enquired how far the ſoul ſhould reſign itſelf up to Gods diſpoſe; I anſwer, He doth in this act ſubmit himſelf to the Soveraignty, Juſtice, and Mercy of God: He throws himſelf down at the feet of theſe Attributes; not one alone, but all of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſubmits himſelf to the Juſtice of God, acknowledging him to be righteous in all his dealings with him; yea, that he cannot in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe do him the leaſt wrong: He is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of injury from the Almighty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he bring long, ſore, and heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon him, waſting and perplexing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, ſuch as make him groane, yet he is righteous, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 33.</p>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:108954:130"/>2. If he ſhould delay to hear him, or give him any anſwer of peace, though he have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and begged, yet it is no affront; it is right, and it is his duty to wait till he will, let it be whenſoever he pleaſeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If he ſhould judge and condemn him, by paſſing a ſentence upon him, and declaring his reward to be with ſinners, ſtill he muſt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If he pleaſe to damn him everlaſtingly, to harden his heart againſt him, yet even this alſo hath he truly deſerved; and it is at his liberty whether he will do otherwiſe with him yea or no, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8. He hath but that which doth properly belong to him, it is but <hi>his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Thus, though the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is loth to be damned, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates it, and cannot think of it without trembling and amazement; yet he yields this to God, that he may with all equity do it, and if he do, he ſhall for ever have cauſe to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and nor in the leaſt to complain againſt him as unjuſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſubmits himſelf to the Soveraignty of God; acknowledging it to be his prerogative, to diſpenſe himſelf to his creatures at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He owns and yields himſelf to be at the Soveraign diſpoſe of God, being one of his creatures, and he may appoint him to what he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108954:131"/> will, without wrong: If the Potter may order his maſs of clay (though his fellow creature) to make veſſels of the ſame lump, for ſeveral uſes, ſome honourable, ſome diſhonourable; much more may God diſpoſe of him, who gave being to the lump it ſelf of which he was made, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence he layes himſelf down before Gods Soveraignty, and yields himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſubject of it: he puts himſelf into God's hands as a Soveraign; as a rebel yields himſelf up freely to his Prince; reſolving with himſelf that God ſhall do with him what he will, whether it be in judgement or in mercy: He will not ſtrive, contend, or make any rebellious reſiſtance againſt him. Thus did <hi>Eli, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 18. and David, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 26. Here I am, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence he reſolves not to reply againſt any of God's diſpenſations, be they never ſo ſharp or ſever upon him. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between being willing to be damned, and being willing that God ſhould be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: God commands us to fly from hell, and yet he expects of us, both to acknowledge that we have deſerved it, and alſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay claim of title to any ſuch favour at his hands, as Salvation, till he doth freely beſtow it upon us; and that if he doth, we ow the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108954:131"/> of it to his Soveraign good pleaſure, <hi>Rom. 9. 18. He hath mercy, on whom he will have mercy.</hi> We muſt deſire and ſeek to be ſaved, but we muſt ſubmit thoſe deſires to him <hi>who hath the Key of David,</hi> and unlocks heavens doors, to none but to whom he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſubmits himſelf to God's free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; to which alone he repairs, and on which only he depends for acceptance: and he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a free and conſtant acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that all that he hath ever received of God, hath flowed from this fountain; his life, his livelihood, the proffers of Grace; and if ever he obtain Salvation it muſt be from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: If God ſhould deny him Grace, he ſhould be juſt; but if for his own names ſake he will take him up into everlaſting arms, this is meer mercy; and every inviting call, every encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging promiſe, every ſmile of his countenance is undeſerved mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a free, ready, willing, earneſt deſire to be ſaved in a way of mercy, and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: he now looks no more for any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in himſelf, or any righteouſneſs of his own by which he might pleaſe God, ſatisfie the law, deſerve favour; he no longer ſticks at any of theſe things, but would have mercy to reap the whole honour and praiſe of his ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:108954:132"/>3. He takes up a firm reſolution to ly and tarry at the door of mercy, to repair to this fountain for all good, and to expect and wait for all here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath not, nor will he make uſe of any other Attribute, or plead for acceptance by; and this hope is in God's Grace, and all his pleading is, <hi>For thine own Name ſake.</hi> As far as mercy may be moved to look favourab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, ſo far his hope reacheth, and no further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence he reſigns himſelf to mercy's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal: <hi>Text.</hi> Let God but accept of me, take me into his houſe, and now let mercy, do what it ſees fit: May I be but a ſubject of ſaving mercy, I will truſt that for the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here he will wait God's time for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of himſelf in his love: He knows he is at the foot of mercy, and here he will not limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but will tarry his leiſure, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. He remembers it is mercy he hath to do with, and therefore it muſt not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but waited for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If mercy ſeem to turn from him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to burn againſt him; If mercy ſeem not to regard (as Chriſt to the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) yet he will bear all this, and ſtill wait. If mercy ſeem (like that unjuſt Judge) to ſtop its ears, anger to ſit in the countenance of the the moſt high, he will ſubmit, and yet throw
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:108954:132"/> ſelf upon the mercy of an angry and offended God, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is reſolved that if God will accept him, witneſs his love to him, and acknowledge him in Chriſt, his free mercy ſhall have the full and whole Glory of it, and he will engage his heart to magnifie mercy, by degrading himſelf, and keeping in mind his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs: God ſhall have the praiſe of all, his heart ſhall eccho, <hi>grace, grace,</hi> through all his life, and heaven ſhall ring with theſe glorious acclamations to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Goſpel humility, which the ſpirit of God worketh in every ſoul whom he draws home to himſelf: This is a true qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Repentance of Faith, and the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it in reſpect of the term to which the ſinner returnes, <hi>viz.</hi> God: and thoſe that ſo come ſhall find mercy. For the Reaſons why God brings the ſoul thus to his foot, they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. To take away all boaſting from the creature: that the ſoul may have nothing at all before it to confide in:man is emptied of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as long as there is any ſelf-ſoveraignty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in him: he doth not, cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all to come from God, till he utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the diſpoſal of himſelf: He cannot ſee that his Salvation is wholly out of himſelf, as long as he thinkshe may capitulate with God about it. Now <hi>God will hide pride from man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:108954:133"/>2. That his glorious Soveraignty may be fully ſubſcribed to: Hence God will ſave none till they do yield that he might damn them, and hath no obligation from them to do otherwiſe: God will be ſeen in his royalty, to diſpenſe grace from a throne, or not at all, hence we are to go to a <hi>throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4. 16. God's Soveraignty is a moſt precious pearl in his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diadem, and he will not ſuffer it to be pluckt out: <hi>Job</hi> ſhall be convinced of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he returnes his captivity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the grace of God may not lift them up, but keep them low and humble: That they may not deſpiſe others, nor think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond what is meet: that they may <hi>not be high minded, but fear;</hi> that they may always remember <hi>who hath made them to differ</hi> from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and may dwel upon that, <hi>that it is by Grace they are ſaved, and not of themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> Give me leave here to improve the former and preſent <hi>Doctrine,</hi> in a ſerious word of Exhortation; as you would prove your ſelves true penitents, to get and keep humble before God: Ply this work of humiliation, and exerciſe the grace of humility: get humble, walk humbly before the Lord: Renounce ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, and caſt off ſelf-ſoveraignty. For Motive.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider how acceptable an humble ſoul is to God, and how diſpleaſing pride is to him:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:108954:133"/> God takes great delight in thoſe that are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>he dwels with them, Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. If any are like to have more of Gods refreſhing and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence than others, it is thoſe that are humble: where this grace is in exerciſe, God will <hi>give more grace.</hi> Their ſervices are highly eſteemed by God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. he hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reſpect to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider how much reaſon, and how many cauſes you have to be humble, to ſee and count your ſelves vile creatures, and to ly low before God:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your ſins ſhould make and keep you humble: The ſin of your heart, the leproſie of your nature, the body of death, that heart-ful of filthineſs and corruption: your daily ſins of act, in omiſſion of duty, in tranſgreſſing the command; eſpecially your particular enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Pſal. 51. 1. This evil.</hi> It will be a truth for ever that you have committed things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, and are not worthy to be called ſons and daughters of God, an hyred ſervants place is too good for you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your duties ſhould humble you: Haſt thou done any thing for God? it was not thou didſt it of thy ſelf, but the ſpirit in thee. And in all your duties you may ſee humbling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations; how cold your affections? how little impreſſion had they on your hearts? of how little continuance, even <hi>as the morning</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:108954:134"/> 
                     <hi>dew?</hi> How little ſincerity, how much hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie? How little grace, how much corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All your afflictions ſhould humble you: God hath hung many weights on thy heart to cruſh thee, and thou ſhouldeſt be aſhamed that they have brought thee no lower: All perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, &amp; all publick rebukes of God's Providence, all <hi>Wilderneſs Tryals,</hi> are to humble the people of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All God's mercies ſhould humble you; you have not deſerved them, but the contrary. The mercies of your being, preſervation, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial deliverances; above all thoſe ſaving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the grace of God in Chriſt, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal life: In a word; whoever thou art, whether Believer or unbeliever, thou haſt abundant cauſe to be alwayes affecting thy heart unto a low frame, and to bring thee down to the foot of the great God, and ly there as a poor deſpicable nothing, reſigning thy ſelf up to, and placing all thy hope upon his meer love &amp; mercy in Chriſt, and endeavouring that that may have the praiſe and glory of all.</p>

               <p>THe Directions may be: 1. To the awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinner to come humbly to, and wait humbly upon God for his grace. 2. To the believer to carry humbly all his dayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Art thou one, who finding thine own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and hearing of God's plenty, art thinking to make proof of it: Wouldeſt thou ſpeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> then, in a deep ſenſe of thy own unworthineſs Throw thy ſelf down at his feet: would you find God merciful, be you ſure to be humble: And for help,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember how much you have done to provoke God to reject you, and hide his face from you. Think what manner of lives you have led; and in ſpecial how you have ſlighted the Goſpel, deſpiſed the Calls, counſels, reproofs, encouragements that have been given you; how often you have refuſed to accept of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Grace and Salvation; and therefore well may God refuſe to hear you when you cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and bid you <hi>go to the Gods that you have ſerved, Jer.</hi> 2. 28.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:108954:135"/>2. Think how uſeleſs and unprofitable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures you are in your ſelves; no wayes fit to be active in glorifying of him: The whole world is <hi>become unprofitable, Rom.</hi> 3. 12. Have neither will nor power of their own to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God till he reſtore it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. What can you do for him, till your enmity be taken away, your rebellion ſubdued? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his grace can fit you to do him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the leaſt ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See that you have nothing by which you can challenge the leaſt favour from him. It is true, the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>If you believe, you ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but it alſo tells you, this believing is <hi>not of your ſelves, Eph.</hi> 2. 9. Till you believe you are under condemnation; the firſt grace muſt come from him; and it is at his pleaſure whether he will give you to believe or no. He hath indeed freely engaged himſelf in promiſe to believers; but he hath not promiſed to you that he will make you ſuch, and if he do not, you cannot: ſince then the caſe is ſuch, that without Faith no Salvation, and you no way deſerve that God ſhould give it you, but have many wayes provoked him to deny it; what remains but that you caſt your ſelves down at his feet, and ask it, not only as beggars that deſerve no alms, but as traitors that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieted your lives, and ſtand to the courteſie of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:108954:135"/> their Prince of his own free favour to pardon and reſtore them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You that are believers, here is that which may teach you to carry it humbly all your days, and in all reſpects: There is none hath more reaſon to be humble than a child of God, whoſe all is of grace, hath nothing but what he hath freely received: in particular, walk humbly towards God, and towards man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Carry it humbly towards God; and that both in reſpect of his ſpecial and ſpiritual grace, and in reſpect of his outward Providences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his ſpecial and ſpiritual grace; and the both in regard of the firſt gift of ſaving grace, and progreſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the firſt gift of ſaving grace; let the conſtant remembrance of it ſerve to make and keep you humble. And therefore remember: 1. Who thou waſt to whom God brought this grace? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. begin. <hi>One in thy blood.</hi> 2. That thou didſt nothing to the working of this great work, <hi>Eph. 2. 9. Not of your ſelves.</hi> 3. How much thou didſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it; how often thou didſt reſiſt God's calls and counſels, wert obſtinate, rebellious, not hearkening to his Spirit, ſhutting thine eyes, ſtopping thy ears, riſing up againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God often came to thee, and entreated thee, but thou hadſt no mind to hear him, but didſt all thou couldſt to have undone
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:108954:136"/> thy ſoul. 4. The patience which the great God uſed with thee; how long he waited upon thee, pittying chine obſtinacy, bewailing the hardneſs of thy heart, and would not let thee alone, though many a time thou baddeſt him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partfrom thee. 5. Much meditate upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace which was revealed in thy converſion. 1. How few are ſaved, and that thou ſhouldeſt be one of them. 2. That thou art no better than they, haſt nothing more to commend thee to God than <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> had; nothing out of God could move him. 3. Thou didſt many wayes more diſhonour God before thy converſion than any of them did; that young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. might ſhame thee. 4. That the ſame means which harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others converted thee. And when thou haſt laid all theſe things together, put thy mouth in the duſt, and let God's converting grace make thee nothing in thine own eyes: and let this grace never be forgotten, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes magnified by thee: only by humility is converting grace glorified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the progreſs of grace in your ſouls: the people of God meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny changes, exerciſes, temptations; and in theſe, diverſities of out-lettings and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace, and without humility cannot carry it right in theſe interludes: in particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Limit not God to ſuch a meaſure or or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:108954:136"/> of the diſpenſation of his grace: as we ſhould deſire all grace, ſo we ſhould be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for every portion of it: Beggars muſt not be chuſers. <hi>Paul</hi> would have grace to vanquiſh temptation; God would have him content <hi>with grace ſufficient</hi> to keep him from being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by it: If you have any Grace, it is a gift, and if you would have more, you muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be humble when God denies thee the ſpecial communication of grace: Whether it be of enlarged aſſiſtance; though ragged and poor, and canſt ſcarce do any thing, but art ready to ſlip and fall: thou haſt earned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and God knows what is beſt for thee: Or in reſpect of conſolation, thou haſt not thoſe raviſhing apprehenſions which thou wouldeſt, but he ſeems to hide the light of his countenance, complain not, he is ſoveraign and juſt, reſolve to wait, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 17. Be not diſcontented: Thou takeſt much pains, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diligently on all means, and their ſeems to be but little coming in; let not this make thee weary: thou art ſowing, it is not yet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: grieve but fret not; pray, but pine not, and know the harveſt will come in God's time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be willing to follow hard after God, though through many difficulties: We are forward, while our way is fair, but if grace
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:108954:137"/> comes to a tryal, now we ſhrink, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: But this is a time that calls for us to be humble: we muſt now follow God; <hi>as good ſouldiers</hi> we muſt <hi>endure hardſhip:</hi> God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be followed; it is his mercy thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace which may be exerciſed, and the end ſhall be happy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Humbly depend upon, and go to God for all ſupplies of grace in every work you have to do: Proud man would have his ſtock in his own hand, to make uſe of when and as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; but God will have us to come and ask for every Grace, &amp; wait on him for it, and the humble ſoul will do ſo: If you conſider that you deſerve nothing, you will be glad that you may have it for asking: Remember you are but Children, and have not wiſdom enough to manage your own ſtock, but would ſoon prove bankrupts: this ſhould animate you, that whatever you want, God is ready to give, if you ask, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Carry it humbly towards God though he doth not beſtow ſo much grace upon you as on others: We are ſometimes ready to ſay, though I deſerve nothing at God's hands, yet I am as deſerving as another; God can afford ſuch an one ſo much wiſdom, faith, patience, comfort <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why may not I have it as well? This ſpirit of envy and emulation is contrary to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: and this very argument, rightly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:108954:137"/> might make thee ſilent: Is God a free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer? is it his own that he gives? and may he not deal it out at his liberty? <hi>is thy eye evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his is good?</hi> doth not poor man challenge as great a liberty as this is, and will you deny it God? nay, becauſe thou art unworthy, thou haſt cauſe to be thankful that thou haſt any at all, when there are ſo many millions that have none, and who hath made thee to differ from them? yea, call thy ſelf to an account, how haſt thou husbanded thy little? if ill, that ſhould humble and ſilence thee; if well, then comfort thy ſelf, that he who improved his two talents well, had his maſter's <hi>Euge,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Lord's joy. yea, how knoweſt thou, but that their work and temptation is greater than thine, and therefore ſtand in need of more?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Carry it humbly in reſpect of Gods out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward providences: We live in a world of change, and there are varieties of conditions in which we are thrown up and down, and ſhall never carry it right in them without Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Carry it humbly in reſpect of affliction: there are many changes paſſing over our heads, God brings many cloudy and mournful dayes upon his people; he ſees meet ever and anon to chaſten them, and it is fit that a vale of ſin, be <hi>a vale of tears,</hi> All calls us to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:108954:138"/> The Child ſhould ſtoop, when his father is correcting him: Humble ſenſe of our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a fit poſture to meet afflicting times in: For help,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Juſtifie God in all the tryals that he brings upon us: Hence labour feelingly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our deſert, <hi>Dan. 9. 8. Accept of the puniſhment of your iniquity;</hi> ſay the Lord is righteous: You are Believers; what then? Chriſt hath ſatisfied God as a condemning Judge, yet he will lay his fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements upon his faulty Children, and they have no reaſon to complain of being beaten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bear affliction with meekneſs, patience, and ſelf-abhorrence, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. With patience, be in ſubjection to your father, when he doth nothing but right, we ſhould be ſilent, <hi>Job</hi> 40 4, 5. He that is vile, hath nothing to ſay: and with ſelf-loathing, the more we loath our ſelves, the more we ſhall love an afflicting God: <hi>It is the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Look on thy ſelf as a poor inconſiderable thing, and that will teach thee meekneſs: What wonder if a worm be trod on?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth God deal worſe with me than with other ſinful men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Poſſibly ſome are in a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than thou. 2. Doſt thou know any one by nature worſe than thou art. 3. Canſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:108954:138"/> thou ſay thou art afflicted more than thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, or indeed up to it? 4. Is not he the Potter and thou the clay? let him alone, if he be Soveraign thou muſt be ſilent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let every affliction help to embitter ſin to thee: that is one great end of it, to wean us from ſin, and make us know it evil and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and we ſhall bear our afflictions the better, when we know and confeſs that our iniquities have procured them: trouble for ſin will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up other ſorrows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Think not worſe of God or his wayes becauſe of the afflictions you meet withal, but be willing to wait on him through all: Break not with God, nor leave him, nor abate of your love to him: believe that he can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the affliction: and believe that he will ſanctifie it to you: and reſolve with <hi>Job, that though he ſlay you, you will truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Carry it humbly towards God in regard of his mercies. There are many mercies which God beſtowes upon us, and if we would carry worthily under them, we muſt carry humbly: Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Acknowledge your unworthineſs of the leaſt outward mercy; joyn with <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Confeſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. A ſinner is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a piece of bread, or a drop of water; all our daily refreſhments are meer mercy; yea, our very life, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. You never earned
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108954:139"/> your meat or drink, all the work you do is not worth a farthing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wonder that God ſhould do any thing for you: <hi>David</hi> makes a great wonderment at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 4. Art thou a Believer? that is Grace; in thy ſelf a wretched man: There is not the beſt man upon earth, but hath cauſe to ſtand admiring that God ſhould condeſcend to look ſo low as to take any notice of him, or to do him the leaſt kindneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be exceedingly thankful for all God's mercies: Humility only is thankful: That God ſhould give to us, ſuch as we are, ſuch mercies, this makes it exceeding great mercies: to ſee a ſinner, one that deſerves nothing, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drinking, and compaſſed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, this changeth gratitude.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let theſe mercies break thy heart, and quicken thee to obedience: If we did but know our ſelves, the leaſt mercy would do this: That is a proud heart, that is not ſoftened by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and quickened to duty too: The humble ſouls language is, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord? Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. How ſhould I live? What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one ſhould I be who enjoy ſuch favours, who might have been a back-log in hell, or ground between the milſtones of Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? See therefore that you are unſpeakably in debt to God for every favour, be it never ſo little, yet if the ſoul be humble as it ought to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:108954:139"/> be, it will point us to God, and put us upon obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be content with the portion of mercy that you enjoy: It it pride that acknowledgeth not God in what we have, becauſe we want our wills in ſomething that God denies us: An humble ſoul is content with any thing: though he be poor, deſpiſed, afflicted, yet that he lives, hath any health, ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſets him down quiet: Learn to be humble, and that will teach you to cloſe with all God's diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Carry humbly towards men: A true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of our own vileneſs will make us little in our own eyes. Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beware of deſpiſing any, we miſtake, if we think it an effect of true grace to carry it contemptuouſly to any: Are they unworthy? ſo are you, Are they Prodigals? ſo you have been.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Think better of others than your ſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3. He that ſees himſelf vile, will think theſe cannot be worſe than I, it may be they are better, it may be they have better moral excellencies; or have never finned ſo fearfully, ſo ſcandelouſly and againſt ſuch means as I.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Think it not hard to be in low eſteem with others: We are ready to be dejected when men look with low and little reſpect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; But he that reckons himſelf a worm,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:108954:140"/> will not think it ſtrange, if every one treads on him, but wonder he is no more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What ever eſteem God gives thee among men, aſſume it not to thy ſelf; let God have the whole honour of it: Boaſt not of thy excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, or graces, but chuſe rather to be ſpeaking of thy infirmities: and if thou haſt the praiſe or acclamations of others, take it not to thy ſelf, but ſay, <hi>It is by the Grace of God that I am what I am;</hi> who of my ſelf <hi>am nothing</hi> Thus are we in all reſpects to carry over ſelves humbly, and this is the way to obtain grace and favour with God; the way to grow in Grace: yea, by this we ſhall give God his glory, and ſhall enjoy his preſence here; and when he hath dwelt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>In the work of Converſion, there are not only deliberate purpoſes but real acts. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:108954:141"/> of nature, there muſt be firſt reſolving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doing; yet where true grace is, when men are reſolved, they will do. Although the will be the firſt mover, yet it is not the ſole mover, it reſts not in <hi>Elicite,</hi> but proceeds to <hi>Imperate</hi> acts. Of the nature of riſing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have before ſpoken, that which we have now to enquire into, is the inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between grace in the heart, and grace in the life. We ſaw before the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was gracious, and the Reaſon given was, becauſe it was the root and ſpring of practice; it was the beginning of the work in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faculties, which was to influence the whole man: And the ſincerity of it herein diſcovers it ſelf, becauſe, as he ſaid, ſo he did, as he reſolved, ſo he acted. It gives us a note of difference between falſe and true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Here then we may conſider. 1. The evidence of the truth of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 2. What is this practice of Repentance?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the evidence of the truth of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> take theſe Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There may be ſome kind of deliberations and purpoſes in the heart of a ſinner that is unconverted, about repenting and returning to God. Every purpoſe is not an evidence of ſincerity. A man held under the ſting and laſhes of an awakened accuſing Conſcience, may be made to vomit up his morſels, and (in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:108954:141"/> a fright) to make forced promiſes of leaving off his ſinful wayes; and upon the hearing of the Goſpel, may reſolve (as <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Generation of Vipers) te flee from the wrath to come:</hi> diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Conſciences are often hurried to it, raſhly to throw themſelves upon ſuch reſolutions: and ſome viſible practiſe, and that violent for the while.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which diſcovers the falſhood of theſe reſolutions is, that they are very ſhort-lived; they ſoon expire: many of them do not live long enough to make any viſible ſhew in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but die in the womb; many a ſick man in horror, promiſeth Reformation, if God will ſpare him: but he recovers not ſo faſt as his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions decay and die. Others that have had a more forcible impulſe, do a little ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but are like the ſtony ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. they are often too violent to be permanent, and by this diſcover, that they are acted by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal force, and not an inward principle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The whole man is gone away from God by ſin, and therefore the whole muſt return by repentance, Not only the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, but the life is polluted; not the inward man alone, but the outward too is gone away from God, and muſt return to him: now true Repentance is not a partial, but a whole turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: we ow God the whole man, <hi>Soul, Body and Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 23.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:108954:142"/>4. The declarative glory of God is the great thing which all our doings ſhould aim at. In Converſion therefore, we are not only to praiſe him, but <hi>to ſhew forth his praiſe;</hi> and how is this done, but in life Repentance? God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſees the heart, men obſerve and judge of our lives.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Will, being commandreſs over the whole man, is not only to reſolve for it ſelf, but for the whole man. Purpoſing or reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is properly an act of the will, but it is for the whole, it being repreſentative of all, and being able to indent for all: thus the young man promiſeth for himſelf, <hi>I will ariſe,</hi> true purpoſes are an obligation laid on the whole man for the performance of them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hence, if the Will be indeed ſincere in purpoſing, practice will follow. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable to him who knows what power it hath in man. You ſhall find in Scripture, that impenitence, or unconverſion is charged here, <hi>Ezek. 33. 11. Joh. 5. 40. Pſal. 81. 12.</hi> and why? but becauſe where the Will leads the whole man naturally and neceſſarily follows, at leaſt in true and real endeavours. A Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may indeed fail in the manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, when his Will is intenſe: but yet, where purpoſes have been taken, and promiſes made of Repentance, and not put forth in endeavour, but men ſit ſtill where they were,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:108954:142"/> thoſe promiſes were made with a deceitful heart, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. 90. and this hinders thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Pſal. 78. 37. their heart was not right:</hi> where the heart is truly given to God, ſuch an one will not ſit ſtill, but be up and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is the practiſe of Repentance which is requiſite?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is a ſpeedy, conſtant, and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavour in the mortifying of Sin, and quickening of Grace, by the help of Gods Holy Spirit. When the Spirit of God hath wrought the habits of Grace in the heart, he alwayes adds the bringing of them forth into act, which is their end and uſe: He that works <hi>the Will,</hi> works <hi>the Deed too,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. ſo that the Soul no ſooner is furniſhed for its work, but it ſets about it: when Chriſt raiſed any, or healed them, they roſe and walked: ſo that practical Repentance is nothing elſe but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The buſineſs of this Grace, or that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which it is converſant, is the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin, and quickening of Grace: riſing out of Sin, is a rejecting, relinquiſhing, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it off, which is done in mortification. Sin claims the power of a Prince in a natural man, commands him, <hi>Reigns over him,</hi> Rom. 6. 12.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:108954:143"/> It muſt therefore be vanquiſhed, its dominion caſt off, by ſuch as riſe out of it: Sin ſo dwells in us, that it is no more left than it is mortified: returning to God, is an exciting of Grace, a quickening of it, it is an exerting of faith in him, and love to him, in theſe Repentance conſiſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is to be done in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be uſing all means to ſtrengthen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Sin: the more we hate Sin, the more we are gone from it; he whoſe heart moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors it is gotten furtheſt off from it: Hence, there is an uſing ſuch helps as may make it loathſome: which are a viewing the evil nature of it as diſcovered in the Word of God, <hi>viz.</hi> its pollution, its contrariety to God, the wrong it doth the Soul: and alſo the croſs of Chriſt, on which we ſhould <hi>crucifie the World and its Luſts,</hi> Gal. 6. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be by all wayes engaging our hearts to God, to love and fear him; and hence to get more and more perſwaded of his goodneſs, of the riches of Grace in Chriſt, of the great happineſs of thoſe whom he admits into favour with himſelf: the better we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and perſwaded of God, the more intenſe will be the actings of our Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The qualities of this act are theſe three,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:108954:143"/>1. It is a ſpeedy work: if repentance be begun in the heart, it cannot reſt there, but preſently breaks forth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 3. the young man no ſooner purpoſed, but he practiſed, his reſolutions were no ſooner ſealed, but he falls upon them; the Soul that is throughly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſees ſo much reaſon, and feels ſuch urgent neceſſity; Sin is made ſo bitter, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented ſo deſireable, and his preſent ſtate ſo dangerous, that he cannot be at reſt till the thing be done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a conſtant work: the practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not a tranſient but a permanent act: he that begins right in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, holds on all his life: <hi>Paul</hi> quickens his <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to the work of Mortification af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long ſtanding in Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. there is Sin in Believers all their life, and ſo much Sin, ſo much diſtance from God; they had need then to be turning all their dayes. The true Chriſtian is in his way, travelling out of his far Countrey, and he cannot ſit ſtill till he be gotten to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an induſtrious work: when a thing is difficult, he that is in good earneſt will take pains: it is not light skirmiſhes, but a warfare that muſt accompliſh this buſineſs: his life therefore is an agony, be attends on the word with diligence, prayes with all importunity, as one that is oppreſſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. 14. ſets a ſtrict
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108954:144"/> watch over his heart and life, <hi>looks to his wayes,</hi> flies from temptations, endeavours that every ſtep of his life may be a ſtep farther from ſin, and nearer to God, and in this race he runs as faſt as he can.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fruit of all is, Sin dies, and Grace grows daily; I mean in the progreſs of his Chriſtian courſe: he hates Sin more, loves God more, gets more ſtrength againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and more agility in Gods ſervice; thus <hi>he renews his ſtrength, mounts up with wings as Eagles, runs and is not weary, walks and doth not faint,</hi> Iſa. 40. ult.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> 1. For Information:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here ſee how vain it is for men to reſt in empty and impracticable purpoſes of repenting and returning unto God, as if therefore their ſtate were good. True Repentance indeed begins at the Will, but it is as certain that if it be true, it reſts not there but proceeds farther, and the whole man will be exerciſed in it; if the heart be really turned to God, that man is right; but then his life will be changed too.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine doth not blame men for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and promiſing, but for doing no more, for ſitting ſtill and thinking they have done ſufficient: beware then of reſting here: ask your hearts on what grounds they purpoſed, &amp; if good, why then do they not perform them? Heaven will not. be won with a few empty
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:108954:144"/> wiſhes, and faint promiſes; but there muſt be wreſtling, ſtriving, overcoming: the Son pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Father to go and work in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, but went not, and what did that promiſe come to? God will not be ſo mocked.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It plainly condemns ſuch as have relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed or abandoned their reſolutions: they promiſed Repentance, &amp; practiſe impenitence: how many in affliction have engaged to God, to leave off their vain courſes, and no longer follow fooliſh things, they would ariſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, and if he would give opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they would make it appear; but after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while they get the maſtery over their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, ſtill their Conſciences lick their wounds whole; now are their reſolutions bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, their promiſes forgotten, their old wayes pleaſe them again, and ſo <hi>the Dog returns to his vomit.</hi> Let ſuch conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God takes notice of, and keeps a record by him of all thoſe purpoſes and promiſes and will one day call you to an account for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is the way to be more hardened in Sin, and make your converſion the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; this is to quench the Spirit, and provoke him to ſtrive no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will be a ſad remembrance in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, to think, how near you once were to Heaven, and yet thus thruſt your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:108954:145"/>
                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. Elſe they will come to nothing; they will prove but the Fools Dream, and Sluggards Wiſh: God will one day ſay to you, why did you not do as you thought? why did you ſtand ſtill, or go backward?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe reſolutions are the ſuggeſtions of the Spirit of God, calling you to your duty, and if you neglect them, <hi>you quench the Spirit,</hi> and ſo provoke him to forſake you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe are reſolutions not to be neglected or repented of: they are the beſt purpoſes that ever you made in your lives; they have a right object before them, and there lies a neceſſity on you, if you will ever do well to practiſe them: For 1. Something muſt be done, or elſe you periſh: there is no lying ſtill where you are, where there is nothing but Famine and miſery. 2. If you return to your old wayes and courſes, it is but to act over your old miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: the World will never be better than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Wilderneſs; if you go to it, you do but return to Famine and deſtruction. 3.

Satan is politick, our hearts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and theſe ſeek to while off the work, and make us believe it is enough to promiſe now, and practiſe at leaſure: riſe and go while your reſolutions are hot, they will elſe cool by degrees, till they have no heat nor motion in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Enter not upon debates about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Satan will plead, Fleſh and Blood will reaſon; you can no way more gratifie your Enemy than to enter a review, and bring the matter into queſtion and deliberation agen: thus they not only gain time, which may be an irreparable loſs, but have alſo many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to break off and diſanull the thoughts of your hearts.</p>

               <p>WE come now to the third part of the Parable, expreſſing the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Prodigal found with his Father, which was with all kindneſs, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſſions of greateſt love. The purpoſe of it is to ſet forth the riches of Gods Grace, and inexpreſſible bounty to repenting Sinners; and ſo expreſſeth the great benefit that come by believing, deſeribed, <hi>ver. 20, to 25.</hi> and here are two things to be noted: 1. The meeting and greeting between him and his Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. 2. The Proviſion made for, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment afforded to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24. In their meeting and greeting there are two parts: 1. His Fathers carriage towards him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. 2. His deportment towards his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. In his Fathers carriage towards him we are to obſerve, 1. The time of it, <hi>when he was yet, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The manner of it, in ſeveral circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:108954:147"/>1. To begin at the time when this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment or treaty was, it is expreſſed by the circumſtance of place, at ſuch time as he was at a great diſtance from him: the right mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Phraſe is of weight to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for the confirming of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrine of Repentance. Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it to be ſpoken by way of anticipation, and that this part of the Parable doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the foregoing in order of time; but that as in the ſecond part he had deſcribed the Sons repentance in the order and method of it as it was done by him; ſo in this third part, ſetting forth the Grace of God, by the Fathers enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he begins it at the firſt diſcoveries of it, and that before (being the leading cauſe of) his Repentance, <hi>q. d.</hi> before he could riſe &amp; come to his Father, he came to himſelf Others ſuppoſe the order of time is here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and ſo account that here are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſaving Grace, and ſo put over the former to preparatory work, <hi>q. d.</hi> whiles he was reſolving, and practiſing to uſe means with a preparatory hope, God comes in with ſaving Grace. But I cloſe rather with the firſt of theſe: for doubtleſs this ariſing and going, muſt expreſs true Repentance; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in our Text diſcovers the preventing Grace of God, and ſhews the original of his favour to be of himſelf, and the beginning of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:108954:147"/> the application of it to be before any Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ours: we might be ready to think that the Sons Repentance was that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <head>DOCT. <hi>In the work of Converſion Gods free Grace prevents, and ſo becomes the firſt and leading cauſe of our Salvation.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The firſt expreſſions of Gods ſaving love meet the Sinner when he is a great way off: nature doth not prevent Grace, but Grace na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: it is not with God as with humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe hearts are turned with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens humble and ſubmiſſive ſubjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them. Gods Grace indeed appears in receiving the truly penitent, but it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved by their penitence, nor doth it here begin; but it is the firſt, and leads all the cauſes of Salvation. By the Grace of God, I here underſtand all that ſpecial good will which he bears to any of the Children of men, in appointing them Heirs of Glory; which Grace firſt appears to any in particular, when it effectually works for their Salvation: Grace neither is tied to, nor waits for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:108954:148"/> upon the natural operations of men. A brief opening of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> may be couched in a few Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The natural man cannot by his natural power move one ſtep towards God: the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mprovements of nature by our own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, bring us not one foot in our way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven: the Scripture expreſſions of mans being dead, impotent, dry bones, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though <hi>Metaphors,</hi> yet are not <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole's.</hi> If by the image of God on man, we underſtand the ſanctification of his nature, fitting him for the ſervice of God, that image is wholly defaced, and there are not ſo much as any relicks of it left: Man is <hi>Blind, Deaf, Dumb, Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As God hath appointed his unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo hath he appointed a way in which he will bring them thereunto; and this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by his ordination, a neceſſary medium to the attainment of it: Faith and Holineſs are the way to glory: the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of a <hi>Path of life.</hi> Pſal. 16. ult. out of this way none ever come to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence mans Salvation is wrought appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorily, by bringing him into and keeping him in this way: Eternal life is aſcertained to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. they that find it, and follow it, and loſe it not, never miſs of Glory: the promiſe is ſo firm that it cannot fail, all the difficulty
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:108954:148"/> lies in the performance of what is in order to the receiving it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the diſcovering of this way, and appointing Salvation in it is of Grace, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for God and man were fallen out, and God might chuſe whether ever he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him any more: nor is there any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between what is required, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Salvation: beſides, Chriſt, by whom alone we have acceſs to it, was freely given to open this way.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the bringing of any into, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in this way is alſo of Grace, is the thing which we have now to prove, and will clear the truth of the Doctrine; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this alone is that which removes all legal reſpects from the Goſpel; and the truth of it will hence appear:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That before the Spirit of God begins to work upon him, there is nothing in an elect perſon to diſtinguiſh him from another: he is dead as well as he, <hi>a child of wrath even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. One hath not a better nature, or better diſpoſitions than the other: <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Idolater, <hi>Rahab</hi> an Harlot, <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> no better, <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Blaſphemer and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> and in his rage the ſpirit met him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The very common work of preparation is not of nature, but of grace. There is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and there is ſpecial grace: the Sinner
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:108954:149"/> doth not ſo much as convince himſelf: it is not Conſcience alone, but it is Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, and improved by the Spirit of God, that brings a Sinner under ſenſe of ſin and miſery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. man is naturally ſtupid, a convinced Sinner is nearer the Kingdom than another, this is not of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Saving Faith whereby we are entituled to Salvation, is not of man himſelf, but of grace: <hi>he that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> but God gives men to believe, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. it is the gift of God.</hi> Men would live and die in unbelief, did not he exert his Almighty power: Faith is a creating work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and the operation of the ſame power which raiſed Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſaving efficacy of all the means of Grace is of God: it is not in them, they have not power in themſelves to produce this grace in us, but that is according to his pleaſure: it was he that touched <hi>Lydia's heart,</hi> Act. 16. the vertue of the means, lies not in the skill, grace, good-will of inſtruments, nor all their induſtry but in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. ſome are converted at the firſt Sermon they ever heard, others have heard a thouſand, and are yet in their Sins: Sermons are but the Prophets ſtaff in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though Gods ordinary method be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> firſt to prepare the Soul for Faith, before he infuſeth it, yet, not only the preparation is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:108954:149"/> of Grace, but the ſoul thus prepared, is, before believing, a great way off from God, he is ſtill in a ſtate of nature, hath nothing in him that can challenge this Grace; but if God beſtow it upon him, it is his meer favour: there are many who have a common work, and it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds no farther: they have had many awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings, ſhakings, terrors; taken up many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, made many promiſes; and yet never paſt from death to life, but have either ſtaid here, or gone back again: nay, God is here Soveraing, the Sinner is dead ſtill, and hath not a promiſe that God will give him life: God when he paſſeth by, may either look upon him, and ſay to him <hi>Live;</hi> or he may paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>USE 1. <hi>For Information:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the abſoluteneſs of the Grace of God: it muſt needs be every way wholly free: the firſt cauſe hath no dependence upon any other, or any other but a voluntary obligation to them: hence they undertake a vain task, that will give any reaſon of mans Converſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Gods will; or why theſe and not thoſe are converted and ſaved: if there were any to ſway that, it were not the leading cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the infallibility of the converſion and ſalvation of Gods Elect; becauſe it flows from Grace as that higheſt cauſe of it. If it did firſtly depend upon any thing in us, our muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:108954:150"/> would expoſe it to hazard, and thence it would be dubious, and alwayes queſtionable: but if Grace lead, all is certain; for who or what can be able to fruſtrate Grace, or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it in all that it hath deſigned for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? <hi>of Grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reaſon why the means convert at one time, and not at another; and one man and not another. Many a powerful Sermon, awakening Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> paſs, and the man ſtill <hi>goeth on frowardly in his wayes,</hi> but at laſt, that which ſeems to be in it ſelf of leſs efficacy, awakens, melts, humbleth, healeth the Soul: but this is when Grace begins to work, and that, only that, is irreſiſtible, man's ſinful heart is too hard for every thing elſe; and this is done when and where God pleaſeth, <hi>John</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That no man can lay any engagement upon God to do him any good. No man can be too ſoon for him: we cannot ſtir till he moves us; we can do nothing for him, till he firſt doth for us, and in us: and hence thoſe whom God paſſeth by, and leaves in their ſin, have no juſt ground of complaint, which if they could do any thing firſt to oblige God, they might have a ſhew for.</p>
                  <p>USE 2. <hi>For Exhortation:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the unconverted; be hence adviſed,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:108954:150"/>1. Not to think to earn Grace and Glory by your own endeavours, or to do that of your ſelves which may bring you under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant promiſe of life; this will never be: were there no more in the Goſpel, but only that counſel, <hi>believe and be ſaved,</hi> the grace of the Goſpel would do us no good: but when God ſpeaks of making us to believe, of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will and deed, that is the life of Goſpel Grace: Chriſt bids us to come, but if he come not firſt, he would keep his Salvation to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to put away the grace of God from you till you have made your ſelves fit for it. Many ſay, what have I to do to ask Grace, who am ſo vile and cannot come to God? I anſwer, none hath more need of it than ſuch an one: and therefore do not ſay, I will wait till I have fitted my ſelf; but wait on God for his preventing grace, to fit and prepare, and turn you unto him: ſay not, if I could get up yonder to him, it would be well, but wait for him to come to your pit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not to reſt in means and endeavours, as if they were able to do for you what you need; but look up to Grace to help you to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means, and bleſs that attendance for your Spiritual good. Promiſe not to your ſelves any thing from Ordinances themſelves, but only ſo far as he ſhall breath in them:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:108954:151"/> Wait therefore for the <hi>north and ſouth wind to blow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be willing to wait the leiſure of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. If that lead, it muſt not be limited, but ſuffered to take its own time; only it is our duty to be waiting in the uſe of all means, not growing weary, fainting or repining.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the converted, learn you alſo from hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to be proud of your grace, or think highly of your ſelves above others: He hath but a ſhadow of grace, and not that which is true, who is apt to ſay, <hi>I am not as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> It is certain, where grace is moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, there the creature is leaſt in his own eyes, not arrogating or aſcribing any thing to it ſelf. That Grace is the moſt inſuſpectible and renders us moſt unworthy in our own eſteem.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would you be ſerviceable in your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the glory of God, be directed to go to him in all you have to do, for his grace, that by it alone you may undertake. <hi>Paul</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any thing, ſo Chriſt ſhall ſtand engaged to ſtrengthen him. It may teach us to begin every work with prayer, which we deſire to have ſucceed; for if God be not in it, leading and ſtrengthening, it will certainly fail: Not all other advantages of helps and means will be otherwiſe then abortive, if grace give them
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:108954:151"/> not their efficacy. If you ſet about any thing without engaging God in it, the very ſpring, and riſe, and ſtrength of all is wanting.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you find the work of Converſion wrought in your ſelves, or ſee it wrought in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, be ſure to aſcribe it to the grace of God as the leading cauſe. No fleſh hath any cauſe to glory, but all the glory is his due: you have uſed means, attended on ordinances, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in duties, &amp; now you find grace coming in upon theſe, Faith to believe in Chriſt, and rely upon him, an heart ſubdued to obedience; ſay not now that this is your own work; you ſaw not how it came in, but by this effect you are led up to the cauſe, and muſt ſay the finger of God was in it: Others have done the like for the matter of it, and never the near. You ſee that your labours with your Children or your ſervants are bleſſed, your reproofs and counſels take effect; think not now that you have done the work, or deſerve the praiſe of it; but conſider it: God's bleſſing upon your labours which havh done all: others have been as careful, and yet can ſee no fruit, God ſo diſpenſeth himſelf to the Children of men, as to take away all boaſting, and when we look upon all our gains &amp; attainments we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>Paul, it is by the grace of God we are what we are.</hi>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:108954:152"/> Had not he come home to us, we had never gone forth to him; had not he been gracious to us, we had died in our ſins. Have you ſeen your ſin and miſery? he opened your blind eyes; have you aroſe and gone to him? he ſaw you firſt, and being moved with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion came to you, and took you up in his arms. Study therefore to live to the praiſe of his Grace; and ſtill wait upon him for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it; for the compleating of your Salvation, and bringing of you to glory, knowing <hi>that he who hath begun a good work in you, muſt alſo perfect it to the day of the Lord,</hi> if ever it be done; and except he leads, you can never follow.</p>

                     </gap>, not capable of being moved with any outward object; and unchangeable in his will; and hence never more propenſe to any thing at one time, than at another, but performes all things according to the everlaſting counſel of his will which is unalterable: Yet, ſpeaking of himſelf after the manner of man, he aſſumes affections, as love, hatred, joy, compaſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>in operibus ad extra,</hi> or in the works of providence there are ſuch manifeſt fruits, as are wont in men to proceed from ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that we may ſee ſomething reſembling this deſcription, in the preſent caſe; obſerve then.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The object of compaſſion is a miſerable thing: A creature brought into diſtreſs, groaning under his miſery, and ſtanding in need of his ſuccour: Such an one is the ſinner: he is one famiſhing, and ready to dy; he is the forlorn creature, a miſerable wretch, going without hope to the pit; an helpleſs creature, whom no created being can relieve and rid of his miſery, he is both poor and periſhing, as we before heard.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:108954:154"/>2. The affections which go into compaſſion are two,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grief; whereby the mind is moved and troubled at the creatures miſery: the ſight of it oppreſſeth the heart, when he ſees it; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to bear the ſight of it; hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo often proceed ſighs and tears of pity over the object. Thus God alſo (ſpeaking in our dialect) ſeeing poor Sinners in their miſery, expreſſeth himſelf like one whoſe heart is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burſt, <hi>Hoſ. 11. 8. How ſhall I give thee up? how ſhall I deliver thee? my heart is turned; my repentings are kindled.</hi> And after like manner, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. in this grief alſo we are wont to be troubled at our ſelves if we have done any thing to bring the creature into ſuch a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, and hence we relent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and ſo God alſo ſpeaks of himſelf, in the forecited, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love; for without love there can be no compaſſion: hatred is inexorable; it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and triumpheth in the miſery of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and the more miſerable it ſees him, the more it can rejoyce in it: but compaſſion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues good will: hence God uſeth ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions concerning <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31. 10. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The natural operation of this affection in us, is to ſtir us up to do what we can for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:108954:154"/> the ſuccour of the perſon thus in miſery. If we do indeed throughly pity the condition of one that is in ſorrow, we cannot ſit ſtill: this affection will hale men to action, they will certainly afford the beſt help they can: thus God by vertue of this compaſſion of his, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, ſaves, delivers the Sinner, frees him from miſery, reſtoreth him to a better ſtate, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſets him on work, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. <hi>My bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the clearing up of the Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 1. That God is a God of compaſſion. 2. That this is the moving cauſe of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which he ſhews to a Sinner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That God is a God of Compaſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it belongs to his Attributes, <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Hence his People aſcribe this title to him, <hi>Pſal. 86. 15. But thou oh Lord art a God full of compaſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe his works declare him to be ſo: his works of providence towards his viſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant people evince it, <hi>Pſal. 78. 37. But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of compaſſion forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not.</hi> His works of ſpecial favour towards his Elect, in pardoning their Sins, and accepting of them to be his Children, do more notably confirm it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:108954:155"/>2. That this is the moving cauſe of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the mercy which he ſhews to a ſinner, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the nature of God: He is the firſt mover to his own actions, and cannot poſſibly be moved by any thing out of himſelf: Hence man's pity and God's, differ in reſpect of the the moving cauſe: Man hath ſuch an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on habitually, but it lyes ſtill till an object ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it; but God is otherwiſe, it moves it ſelf: That which moves in us, hath the reſpect of a cauſe, and that which is a cauſe is in nature before the effect, but the good will of God to man, whence all his compaſſion flowes, was from Eternity, <hi>Jer. 31. 3. I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore in loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have I called thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God renders this is a reaſon of all his mercy towards his Creatures: When he ſpeaks of pitying and relieving them, he reduceth it to our good-wil, and mercyful nature, <hi>Jer. 3. 12, 13. Hoſ. 11. 9. Rom. 9. 15. Pſal.</hi> 78. 38.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe there is nothing in the Creature can be rendred as a ſufficient moving cauſe of his compaſſion towards it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not the Creatures miſery in it ſelf, For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſinners miſery is not a fortuitous thing, or befalling an innocent perſon, but it is the juſt penalty of his ſin, inflicted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:108954:155"/> and that according to the equity of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſt Law, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. A man for the puniſhment of his ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then muſt God be equally moved to compaſſion to all ſinners, who are alike miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and alike need ſuccour; and then why are not all ſaved? That compaſſion which ſaves one, could as well ſave another, but there are but ſome ſharers in this ſaving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, others ſuffer his rigour, <hi>Rom. 11. 7. The Elect obtained it, the reſt were blinded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not their legal convictions, and tenors, and confeſſions and ſoftly walkings <hi>&amp;c, i. e.</hi> No preparatory work: For, 1. The Son was for all them a great way off, when his Father pittied him. 2. There are that <hi>Call,</hi> and God <hi>will not hear, that ſeek him early, and ſhall not find him,</hi> Prov. 1: 28:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not legal Repentance and Reformation, turning from many ſinful practiſes, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many things: For theſe are nothing but ſin: <hi>Eſau</hi> repented and wept, but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited him not, <hi>Heb. 12: 17: Herod</hi>'s reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on engaged not God to him. In ſumm, God's compaſſion is according to his will, and that is abſolutely free, nor to be regenerated by the creature, <hi>Rom:</hi> 9: 16, with 18:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe God's deſign in the Salvation of a ſinner is the manifeſtation of his Grace;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108954:156"/> which grace diſcovers it ſelf in ſhewing him compaſſion. Now this grace of God hath deſcribed its ſubjects from eternity; and therein diſtinguiſhing Grace is made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when it falls upon a ſubject that hath nothing in it to engage him, nor could of it ſelf do any thing in the leaſt to move him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> 1. Here we ſee how far the name and term of merit is a ſtranger from Goſpel lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and what care we ought to take that we do not entertain any thoughts of it. God is no debter to his creatures except voluntarily: as it was free to him to make them, ſo alſo to aſſign them their end and uſe: and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he deſigned or appointed no creature to any uſe, but withal compleatly furniſhed it for that end; and if, through its own default, that be loſt, it can claim no reſtitution at Gods hands: hence let no man think that his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be a ſufficient ground to engage Gods mercy to him; no nor his acknowledgment of his ſin and miſery neither: for if we ſtand at the tribunal of Juſtice (unto which merit is properly reckoned) it doth not deſerve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for a delinquent to fall down at the Judges feet, confeſs his fault, and beg that it may be paſt by, and not imputed to him: if the Law condemns him, and he ſtands guilty before the Bar, it is only a free pardon that can acquit him. Now though an humane Judge
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:108954:156"/> may be moved by the ſubmiſs and lamentable expreſſions of a juſtly condemned perſon; yet God is capable of no ſuch impreſſions; but if he intends a ſoul good, he puts this very frame into him, and then accepts him in this way, though not for this carriage: but in all this there is not any room or occaſion to ſpeak of merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> 2. Learn hence alſo not to be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged from going to God in the ſenſe of your own miſery: Though you are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and have nothing of your own to plead with him, which deſerves to impetrate his mercy, yet you ſee here that his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion leads him to be merciful, and that the object which it hath choſen to expreſs it ſelf unto, is miſerable ſinners, ſuch as are every way miſerable; helpleſs and hopeleſs creatures: And if thou knoweſt, findeſt, and feeleſt thy ſelf to be ſuch an one, there is no reaſon to be diſcouraged; thou art one of ſuch whom God hath choſen to expreſs his compaſſion upon; and he who knows thy condition, if he will, can have mercy on thee: Such as are helpleſs, he is ready to help, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 3. It may be a ground of wonderful encouragement to poor ſinners to go to God, and to wait upon him for mercy: to conſider that God is a God of compaſſion, and that this compaſſion is the originial of all the good
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:108954:157"/> which the creature receives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To conſider that he is a God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: <hi>We have heard,</hi> ſay they, <hi>That the Kings of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are merciful Kings.</hi> He is a God that delights to exalt and magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by thoſe titles of <hi>Merciful, Gracious, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, &amp;c.</hi> His bowels ſtir towards, and he pitties dying ſinners, and therefore he comes to their Graves and bids them live. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a pitiful and a compasſionate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a prince, wilbring in rebels apace, to come and throw themſelves upon his mercy, &amp; ſue for a pardon; who if they knew him to be pityleſs and inexorable, would run utmoſt adventures, as thoſe that know they can but dy, and can hope for no better by ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To conſider that this compaſſion is the root and ſpring of the mercy he ſhews: Hence we may ſilence all upriſing of heart, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging temptations, and be animated to break through all. I can do nothing; but if I could, it would but obſcure his compaſſion. Be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, Satan preſents God in arms againſt us, &amp; tells us we muſt appeaſe him with ſacrifices of obedience, but God accepts of no ſacrifice but that of Chriſt; he looks that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy alone ſhould be ſought unto; learn then to make heaven ring with thy cries; ask mercy, put God in mind of theſe Attributes, which he hath commended himſelf in, to the Children of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:108954:157"/> men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. put that into every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to encourage thy hope, <hi>Pſal. 86. 5. Thou art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</hi> And <hi>Dan. 9. 9. To thee Lord our God belong mercies, and forgiveneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 4. For Exhortation to Believers: This truth tells you what is the work you have to do all your lives; <hi>viz.</hi> To adore, admire and magnifie God's compasſion, thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bowels of mercy that have appeared in your delivery out of all that miſery, into which Sin had caſt you: This is the great ſubject which ſhould take up the thoughts and words of the Saints, <hi>Grace, Grace;</hi> it ſhould be the voice with which the Temple ſhould reſound. Think therefore often with yourſelves, where you once were, what was your former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who it was that transformed you, when it was that he looked upon, and had regard to you; what miſerable ſinners you were, and how near to the pit of eternal deſtruction. Follow this compasſion up to the beginnings of its actings towards you; think not that it only met you as you were returning, but call to mind, that it came to your dungeon and lifted you out thence; that it followed you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your far Country and fetcht you from among the ſwine, or elſe you had ſtill been there, and periſhed for ever.</p>

This love of God was from eternity, ſealed up in his own breaſt: It began generally to be publiſhed and made known in the world, as ſoon as man had by his fall brought ruine and miſery upon himſelf,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:108954:159"/> and his progeny; as was whiſpered in that firſt Goſpel promiſe, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. He ſhall break thy head.</hi> And more abundantly ſhone forth when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had laid down his life at the foot of Juſtice: but theſe were more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral demonſtrations of it. It more eſpecially and particularly firſt begins to appear to the ſinner himſelf, then when he is regenerated, and eternal life begun in him. The manner and nature of this work, was then opened when we conſidered the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s return; that which is here to be obſerved, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this love, and how or wherein it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its ſelf, according to the ſpiritual meaning of theſe phraſes. I might here expatiate, but I ſhall confine this diſcourſe to the words in our text, by a reduction of them to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt expreſſion of this love is, in that <hi>he ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to him;</hi> herein is intimated a twofold declaration of divine love; one poſitive, the other comparative.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Poſitive, It points out God's coming to the ſinner where he is, to beſtow his grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. The ſinner could never have gone to God, he therefore cometh to him: He was a great way off, and could come no nearer: <hi>The rock of his ſalvation is higher than he is.</hi> Though as to rational and common actions, man is capable of uſing means, yet as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:108954:159"/> life-actions, he is void of a principle of them: like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he is both dead, and bound in his grave cloths: God therefore by his ſpirit comes to his graves ſide, to his pits mouth, where he is periſhing, and thence he fetcheth him,: and is not this wonderful love? Had not God come hither, the ſinner neither could nor would ever have come to him: that is Emphaticall, <hi>Zech. 9. 11. I have ſent forth my Priſoners out of the pit where there is no water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Comparative; he not only comes, but he comes in haſt, to the help of the poor dying creature, <hi>Bis dat, qui citò dat.</hi> Running is a note of ſpeed, and ſignifies a great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the affections: God makes great haſt to bring relief to a periſhing ſinner. The Heathen painted love with wings, noting the ſwiftneſs of this affection in its actions. Here therefore God's wonderful love to a ſinner manifeſts it-ſelf, in that he comes to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for, and brings his grace, when it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next expreſſion of his love is, <hi>He fell upon his neck.</hi> When men embraced each other in one anothers arms, they were ſaid to fall upon one anothers necks: It notes embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: And this ſerves to expreſs the favour which God takes a ſinner into: It holds out that union which in converſion is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:108954:160"/> Chriſt and the ſoul: They which were at a great diſtance are now made near. God doth not only come and do ſomething for his relief, but he takes him into his arms; and now thoſe that were enemies, are in mutual embraces: Such were the greeting between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33. 4. Each doth now, as it were, breath himſelf into the others bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; they exchange ſouls, manifeſting by dumb ſigns, that love which is too great for words to expreſs, ſo that by this expreſſion we are taught.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God gives himſelf to the ſinner to be his, and takes him to himſelf, makes himſelf to be his portion, and bequeaths himſelf to him, and receives him into arms of mercy, making him his peculiar treaſure and jewel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he now infuſeth his grace into his ſoul, by breathing ſpiritual life into him: He falls upon him with his ſpirit and grace, and layes the foundation of ſpiritual life in him, by putting a principle of it into his ſoul, <hi>quickening him who was dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He kiſſed him;</hi> this is the laſt thing in the act; and here is great favour indeed, that when he might have killed him he kiſſeth him; this word hath divorſe expreſſions of love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God now opens and reveals that ſecret
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:108954:160"/> and everlaſting love of his to his ſoul, kiſſing was an outward act to intimate an inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Men often did it diſſemblingly, but God alwayes doth it really: Now God begins to give the ſoul to perceive what was his purpoſe of good will to him from eternity, what were his ancient thoughts about him; this is a viſible confirmation of that ſecret love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God now reveals that he is fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to, and at peace with him; that all former diſtances and alienations of heart are wholly taken away; he is no more angry, nor will any more condemn him. <hi>David</hi> kiſſed <hi>Abſolom</hi> to let him underſtand he was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. God never kiſſeth and killeth, as <hi>Joah.</hi> dealt with <hi>Amaſa:</hi> his heart alwayes goes out with his promiſe. It is a juſtifying kiſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that this ſoul ſhall never more have any more cauſe to fear the ſuffering the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his ſins, or being expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The father by this manifeſtly takes his ſon into the ſtate of a ſon: It is a kiſs of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; <hi>David</hi> thus acknowledged <hi>Abſolom:</hi> The ſinner had made himſelf an abject, God now reſtores him again to that inheritance which he had rooted himſelf out of: he is thus taken again into his fathers houſe, and made to enjoy the priviledge of a Child.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God by this draws out the love of the ſoul
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:108954:161"/> to him: breaks his heart, and wins him to himſelf: By this teſtification of his love he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a reciprocal love from the ſinner; makes him now to chuſe God and give himſelf up to him, put himſelf into his hands, and devote himſelf to his ſervice, for all this preſently follows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Thus it is a ſanctifying kiſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All this is done to reſtore comfort to the ſoul: Senſe of his ſin, and the great wrong that he had done to his father, by ſo vilely leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and profuſely ſpending his eſtate, had filled him with ſorrow and bitterneſs; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now kiſſeth him to comfort him: They are called <hi>the kiſſes of the mouth, Can.</hi> 1. 2. which are given in the application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the ſoul, and enabling of him to cloſe with them, ſuck the ſweet out of them, and draw to his conſolation the good that is in them: and thus it is alſo a glorifying kiſs. Put altogether and it telleth us what a wonderful declaration of God's love it is that comes into the ſoul at the hour of Converſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> 1. For Information.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We hence learn that the ſoul is paſſive in vocation: I do not mean as it is a Rational, but as it is a ſpiritual Agent. If God had not come to the ſinner, he had never come to God, nor could he have done it: As well might the widows ſon lying upon the bier, and carrying
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:108954:161"/> to the grave, have fetcht back his departed ſoul as a ſinner dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, recover the loſt Image of God. Hither every Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man ows his ſpiritual original, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to the ſtrength of his nature, or flexibility of his will, but to God, who came to him there where he lay a dying, and whence he was not able ſo much as to lift up his eyes towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without God put the ability into him by reviving Grace. And this proclaims the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful conceſcendency of the great God to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done men and women, in that he is not only ready and willing to receive them when they come to him, but he runs forth to meet them, and to do them good: The condition that all men are lying in, at ſuch time as he ſpeaks that happy word to them, <hi>live;</hi> tends mightily to enhaunce or illuſtrate the unſpeakable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of God, and hence deſerves an ingemiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Ezek. 16. 5, 6. None eye pitied thee, thou waſt cast into the open field; I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, live; yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we ſee that in Regeneration the whole body of graces are brought into the ſoul at once and together. In effectual vocation the ſoul receives Chriſt himſelf, and that not only relatively, by receiving his perſon into ſuch relations wherby he becomes his Redeemer and Saviour, applyes his righteouſneſs to him
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:108954:162"/> for Juſtification, and by marrying him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him among the Adopted Children of God; but alſo really, by the communication of his graces, and filling him with his ſpirit: <hi>He falls upon his neck and kiſſeth him;</hi> all grace is communicated in this act: and there is great reaſon for it, for Chriſt in giving of himſelf to the ſoul becomes its life, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Chriſt lives in me.</hi> And Chriſt thus becomes his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, not only by changing his relative ſtate from what it was, but eſpecially (life being a principle of operation) by putting this new principle into him, in which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſuch habits and diſpoſitions as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to fit him to live ſpiritually: <hi>i. e.</hi> the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of all graces, for all flow from one and the ſame principle, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpiritual life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a conſectary from the former, we hence ſee that at the inſtant of effectual voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſoul is made partaker in every grace; Juſtification and Adoption fully, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Glorification inchoatively, and in their degrees: theſe come all together and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, and are made over to the ſoul in the inſtant in which God converts him: For when God gives Chriſt, <hi>he gives all things with him; Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Yea, he gives him to be all to us, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. He is made of God to us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption</hi> There is a ſucceſſion of theſe Graces, 1. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:108954:162"/> they are to be handled orderly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, and diſtinctly, in the opening of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Goſpel. 2. In the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Believer, who doth not immediatly diſcern all of them. 3. In order of nature and conſequence: But in time they are contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary: and the reaſon is, becauſe the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſealed up in Converſion, and all that is contained in it; <hi>i. e.</hi> all grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We here ſee the Reaſon of the ſudden and ſtrange alteration which we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee wrought in a ſinner: one whom the other day we ſaw bleeding to death in his ſins, rotting in his grave, ſpending all in riot, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all counſels and perſwaſions, going in the ways of deſtruction; now changed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another man, all new in him: yea, one that was wounded under amazement and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of conſcience, deſpairing and dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der convictions; now rejoycing and raviſhed with the experience of the love of God. Theſe are ſtrange alterations, but not to be misbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if we conſider the haſt that God makes to find out, and take into his arms dying ſinners, and the raviſhing embraces he affords them. When God comes, he runs; he may delay a while, and let the ſinner run himſelf out, and not come preſently to convert him; but when he doth come, he comes without delay, nothing ſtops him, <hi>Hab. 2. 2. Cant.</hi> 2. 8.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. What haſt he made: I was dying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing, hopeleſs; but he ſpeedily came, and put under an everlaſting arm: <hi>or ever I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. With what ardour of affection he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy neck: Oh remember thoſe embraces; how he took thee up in his arms, an unworthy, filthy, polluted armful; how kind were thoſe claſpings which encircled thee? thoſe embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which took thee out of thy pit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How he kiſſed thee; breathing his ſoul into thee, and filling thee with his love; pardoning all thy ſins, taking thee to be his ſon again, influencing thee with his grace, in thy far Country ſpeaking comfortably to thee. <hi>Oh! love the Lord all ye his Saints,</hi> and let your hearts boil over in ardent affections to him.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:108954:164"/> and why omitted is not eſſential to enquire; divers reaſons are given, and that which ſeems moſt probable, is that his father's kind carriage, and abundant expreſſion of his love, had left him no room for it, becauſe he now found himſelf accepted in quality of a ſon.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the nature of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſound Humiliation, and Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; which is ſuch as, before grace received from God, cannot act kindly, no not at all. All that the man hath before he is converted, is legal: Take the force of the reaſon in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All acts preſume their habits. It is a principle in Logick, that no effect exceeds the vertue of the cauſe. <hi>The tree muſt firſt be made good before it can bring forth good fruit;</hi> the thorn turned into a fig-tree, if it bear figs. There muſt be an habit before there can be acts correſpondent: there muſt be an eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be any ſight: So there muſt be habitual Repentance, or a principle of it in the ſoul, before there can be exertion of it. Now this principle or habit is not in the ſoul before converſion. Converſion is the turning of a Sinner from Sin to God; this is done by changing his heart and all his faculties; it is by making him a new creature, and he is thus made by the infuſion of the body of ſpiritual graces into him, or laying the foundation of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:108954:165"/> Sanctification in his ſoul. Repentance is a grace, a ſpecial gift of God, and we in the former <hi>Doctrine</hi> obſerved, that all graces come at once, and then when God taketh a Sinner into favour, then he furniſheth him with his grace; hence, being in Chriſt, and being a new creature are convertible, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The act of Repentance is an actual turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Sin, and unto God: and it hath both theſe parts in it, as was before hinted at <hi>verſe,</hi> 18, 19. If it wants one, it wants all; for man, being a dependent creature, muſt have, will have ſome object: Now here the ſoul utterly and everlaſtingly relinquiſheth all its Sinful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 8. It freely and willingly parts with them, and it turns to God, cloſeth with him as the only object on whom it can reſt for Salvation; this is the ultimate ſcope of Repentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 1. Now ſuch an act of chuſing and cloſing with God, which muſt needs accompany Repentance, neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth faith; for a Sinner cannot cloſe with God but by an act of faith, and if there be an act of faith in Repentance, then there was an habit, whence that act flowed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Inaſmuch as Repentance is a change of the affections, which are the feet of the ſoul, carrying it from and to its object; and hence is a fixing them upon ſome other object than
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:108954:165"/> they formerly dwelt upon; where alſo the prime affections mainly diſcover themſelves <hi>viz.</hi> Love and hatred. It neceſſarily prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to this act, a gracious diſpoſition infuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into theſe affections. In Repentance the ſoul is made to hate Sin, which before it loved as its life; and it loves God, whom before it hated; and the one of theſe ſtrengthens the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He hates Sin, becauſe he loves God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſetting thoſe affections on work, and moving them to their proper object, implies a ſanctified change in them; and no other reaſon can be given of their ſo act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The affections being hand-maids of the will, hence a change in them implies a change in the will, and evidenceth that that is turned: it ſignifies that the heart is altered from what it was; for the will exerts it ſelf in and by the affections: When therefore we ſee a man truly to hate Sin and love God, we know that his will is ſet, fixed, his choiſe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made: and where the will is changed, there is converſion wrought: where the ſoul hath indeed choſen God, there is ſaving grace. <hi>David</hi> therefore aſſerts his grace from this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 25.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Repentance is the exerciſe of the grace of Sanctification: It is practical holineſs, which conſiſts in this, to be going from Sin
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108954:166"/> to God. Sanctification hath two parts in it, <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Vivification;</hi> Repentance comprehends them both, brings them in to uſe, and continues them in practice. Now Sanctification is a benefit of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and a fruit of converſion, one of the things for which Chriſt is given to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and is wrought at converſion, as hath been cleared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe, as in Converſion the ſoul receives a principle and power of acting repentance, ſo by this effect of God's wonderful love, there are given to the ſoul abundant advantages, for the helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the more kindly exerciſes of it. The truth is, all Evangelical motives to it, are hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Converting grace makes ſin appear in its own colours. The ſun-light of ſaving grace makes Sin look more ugly than ever: Beauty and deformity are not diſcerned in the dark; the candle-light of common conviction made but obſcure diſcoveries: Now he ſees it Sin, before he did not: he had two diſcoveries of it before; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That it was diſpleaſing to God, his Law being againſt it. 2. That it was a procuring cauſe of miſery, by reaſon of the curſe: Theſe two he ſaw in the Glaſs of the Law. But now grace diſcovers Sin to him. 1. As contrary to the nature of God, oppoſite
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:108954:166"/> to his holineſs, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. 2. Hence to be in it ſelf an odious thing, and that ſeparate from the hell that follows. He now ſees the beauty of grace, and that ſhews him the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God's love manifeſted in Converſion, diſcovers Sin under divers aggravations, which before were not ſeen. 1. That it was againſt that God who had loved him with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. 2. Againſt Jeſus Chriſt who had ſhed his blood for his redemption from hell. 3. Againſt the Holy Ghoſt that had ſo often ſtriven with him, had waited ſo long, and left not till he had turned him, and now ſin appears ſinful, which before appeared only ſorrowful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1. For information;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have here a note of diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a legal and a ſaving Repentance. The Scripture makes mention of both; it tells us of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s repentance as well as of <hi>David</hi>'s: It puts one name upon things vaſtly different; and if we would know how to diſtinguiſh them, here is it to be diſcerned: The one is effected by a ſpirit of Bondage, the other by the ſpirit of Adoption; the one is produced by te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ours, the other by love: the one confeſſeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Sin, vomits up his morſels, takes upon him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of holineſs, driven to it by the diſmal reflexions of his own Conſcience, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:108954:167"/> of the wrath to come: the other is taken into embraces of amity, confirmed with a kiſs of favour; and by this his heart is melted into Godly ſorrow, in his fathers arms he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans himſelf. <hi>The truly broken heart, is an heart broken with love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we ſee when is the genuine ſeaſon of godly ſorrow; and the reaſon why a ſoul that is newly converted is ſo full of bitterneſs, complaints and ſelf accuſations. If a ſoul do not repent and bitterly mourn for Sin now, when ſhall he? before he could not, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there will be no room for it. God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the great Husband man of his Vineyard, deals in great skil with the ſoul: For having broken up the fallow ground of the heart, and ſown the ſeed of grace in it, he now ſends ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſhowres upon it, to water the ridges thereof, that it may be made to bring forth a plentiful Harveſt, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 126. 5. When ſhould ſhowers more ſeaſonably fall on the ground than when the ſeed is caſt in? Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They miſtake themſelves greatly who think that after Converſion the ſoul ſhould do nothing but rejoyce; as if there were now no room <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>r ſorrow for Sin, and ſelf abaſement, becauſe their Sin is pardoned: Whereas, what doth more break an ingenious heart, than the pardoning of ſo great offence, and receiving
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:108954:167"/> him to favour after ſuch grievous provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? God therefore when he hath made large promiſes of what he will do for his People, tells us what ſhall be the fruit of this love of his, <hi>Ezek 36. 31. Then ſhall you remember your evil wayes, and loath your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it be for caution to ſuch as are newly converted; though now they are and ought to be in bitterneſs for Sin, and to mourn for it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God, yet have a care of giving Satan ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby to weaken your faith, and undermine the conſolation ariſing from your intereſt in this grace. Godly ſorrow, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, repentance, are ſo to be exerciſed, as to be helpful to the ſtrengthening, and not become impediments to the exerciſe of and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of faith: Hence make that the great incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Godly ſorrow, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſideration that is againſt that God that loved you; let Divine love be ſet againſt Sin, and that will help both Faith and Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let others beware of irregular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſuch as are mourning for Sin, and full of ſorrow by reaſon of it: Do not take pains to dry up thoſe tears; be not troubled at them, but rejoyce: It is a very pleaſant ſight, an heart-comforting fight, to ſee any truly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin. to give wiſe relief againſt deſpair, is prudence, but rather help and encourage god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow. Though fair weather be pleaſant,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:108954:168"/> yet ſhowers may be more ſuitable, and make the earth more fertile: <hi>Paul</hi> repents not to have been inſtrumental to ſo good a work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here we ſee a reaſon why thoſe that have taſted moſt of the love of God, and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his grace to their ſouls, are moſt low and vile in their eyes: The reaſon is, becauſe the more a ſoul hath had experience of the wonderful undeſerved love of God, it feels the more ſenſible convictions of its own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vileneſs. God's large expreſſions to <hi>David,</hi> made him reflect upon himſelf, and lay himſelf very low, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18, 19. If you are indeed truly converted, and have received the grace of God, you ſhall find this effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own hearts; it will put the meaneſt and moſt abaſing thoughts of your ſelves into you; it will draw out humble confeſſions, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſations, and acknowledgments of your own unworthineſs: This muſt needs put you in mind of your low eſtate, ſinful and miſerable condition, and the unſpeakably free grace of God thereon appearing.</p>
                  <p>USE, 2. For Exhortation: This may ſerve to excite all true Believers to live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant exerciſe of Humility and Repentance: You here ſee it is the proper work of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert: Faith and Repentance are graces for exerciſe, and ſhould take up our whole lives.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:108954:168"/> And to help to this duty, often ponder.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who it was that converted thee; not thy ſelf but God, he came to thee and ſaved thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What an one thou wert before converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a poor <hi>Prodigal,</hi> that had waſted all away, and flagitiouſly provoked, and diſhonoured the Name of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What it coſt to make way for thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the curſed death of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How obſtinately thou didſt oppoſe thine own Converſion: Thou wert horribly averſe to it, and didſt long withſtand the ſtrivings of the holy ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What love God hath expreſſed to thee in thy Converſion: Words fall ſhort, and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are too ſtrait to demonſtrate or give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to it. Set the love of God before thee as a glaſs in which to ſee and hate thy Sin, and love thy God: Let this make thee worthleſs in thine own eyes and account. What expreſſions doth this love draw out from <hi>Paul? 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. Act therefore theſe thoughts upon thy heart, and get thy ſoul warmed with this ſenſe: And more eſpecially,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Art thou a young Convert, newly of a <hi>Prodigal</hi> made, and entertained as a Son? This great change now requires an humble heart, now thou art in the arms of mercy, pour out thy confeſſions, and bemoan thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:108954:169"/>2. Haſt thou at any time more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcoveries of God's love to thee? Now be improving this as an argument to abaſe thee: Ask thy heart, who hath done this? and then, <hi>who am I</hi> that he ſhould do thus for me?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eſpecially if theſe applications are after ſome fall or relapſe into ſuch Sins as have wounded thy peace, and hidden his face for a ſeaſon from thee. Doth he after this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding come again? Wonder, and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of thy ſelf, when thou feeleſt his kiſſes and embraces again, empty thy ſoul in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and ſelf-judging acknowledgments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom; ſo ſhalt thou be led on to more and more experiences of his wonderful love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs.</p>

Here we may obſerve an Allegorical deſcription of the great benefits which God beſtows upon a ſinner on believing, or the wonderful change of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on Converſion. Whiles the Son is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:108954:170"/> complaining of his unworthineſs, and accuſing his own prodigality, his father, not ſo much by words, but by real acts gives him to find what favour he is received into.

                  <head>DOCT. <hi>The day of a ſinners Converſion to God is a day of great rejoycing.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>When God comes to receive a penitent <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal</hi> into favour again, it is a time of ſinging and mirth. It is a day of joy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To God himſelf the father teſtified his joy for his Son's recovery, by his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo doth God by his of a ſinner: though God properly have no affections, which are paſſions, and tokens of imperfection, yet he aſſumes ſuch things to himſelf for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and not only ſo, but providentially in the application of himſelf to the ſoul, he doth ſuch things, as are witneſſes of ſuch affections in men: Where men love much, they will do much: Feaſts are tokens of joy, great feaſts of great joy.</p>

He is a choſen veſſel.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the great change wrought: <hi>His ſon was dead and is alive, was loſt and is</hi>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:108954:171"/> 
                     <hi>found.</hi> With what joy did thoſe women whoſe ſons <hi>Eliſha</hi> and Chriſt raiſed, entertain them: How glad is a tender Parent to find a Child that hath been loſt? here is matter of much joy: Thus it is with a ſinner: he is raiſed from a grave of ſin, and found in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his wandring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe now God's great deſign of glorifying his grace in this ſinners recovery is brought about, the foundation of that work is laid in his heart; now all men are glad when their main deſigns are accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the bleſſed Angels: Theſe may in part be looked upon as the ſervants here em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, who attended cheerfully in this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for they <hi>are ministring ſpirits for the heirs of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 1. 14. And that Angels are glad at a ſinners Converſion is aſſerted, <hi>context, verſ.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From their relation to Believers, they are their brethren, fellow Servants, fellow Citizens, and ſuch for whoſe ſalvation they do miniſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the great delight they take in the glory of God, for which as they were made, ſo they lay out their utmoſt labour and endeavour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect could have any acquaintance with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this lower World, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:108954:171"/> ſhout and ſing for joy; ſuch is their love to their brethren now it is perfected, but,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is certainly a joy to the Saints on earth, to them that love God, to ſuch as are true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and thus our goodneſs in one reſpect extends to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. It cannot but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their hearts with great joy when they ſee or hear of any that are brought home to God, the family of Saints are much refreſhed with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe God is glorified by it, and Satan defeated: God hath one more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and Satan loſeth a vaſſal by it: It adds to the enlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and his Name is ſo much the leſs diſhonoured in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe they have now one more fellow citizen of the <hi>new Jeruſalem:</hi> the Church militant is augmented, and the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſhall be encreaſed by it: Believers are called <hi>Citizens, Eph.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe it is that they have prayed for, and in their places endeavoured: All Chriſtians pray for it when they ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi> and ſome have prayed for it in particular: Their Godly Miniſters have laboured earneſtly about it, with God, and with them: And theſe are the Servants that miniſterially apply theſe things to them,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:108954:172"/> even all conſolation, and it is a joy to them to do it. Their Godly Parents and Neighbours have long waited for this day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it brings to them the glad tydings of great joy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And that I chiefly aim at, It is a day of great joy to the Convert himſelf. I do not ſay that he is alwayes immediatly under the clear apprehenſion of it, though often great meaſures of comfort are for the preſent given him; but now the foundation of all his joy is laid: God now applys his great love to him; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The beſt robe is put upon him. <hi>[Gr. the firſt robe.]</hi> There is no other like it, and that is the robe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, whereby his rages are removed, and the ſhame of his nakedneſs covered: The poor <hi>Prodigal</hi> had worn himſelf out, was all in tatters; he is not only clothed, but royally apparelled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13, 14. The word [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] ſignifies a long garment that comes to the ankles cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole body: This hides all his ſpiritual deformity, covers all his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ring is put on his hand: Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of Adoption: A ring with his fathers ſeal, acknowledging him to be of his family: others, to the ſame purpoſe, take it to be a token of his enfranchiſment. Among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:108954:172"/> none but free <hi>Citizens</hi> were to wear rings: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for his ennoblement, among the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nations, none but the Nobility had this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: others for the ſeal of the ſpirit: The Wedding Ring was given as a ratification of Marriage; ſo now the union between Chriſt and the ſoul is ſealed and confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Shoes are put upon his feet: The feet are the affections, ſhoes are both for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for ſaving the feet from harm: Theſe ſhoes <hi>are the preparation of the Goſpel of peace, Eph.</hi> 6. 15. The ſoul is adorned with ſanctifying grace, and the affections pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from being gravelled, and galled with the pebbles of carnal deſires.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fatted Calf is killed <hi>[Gr. the fatted Calf, ſacrifice it]</hi> This intends Chriſt, and may bear ſome reſpect to the Sacrament of the Supper: the ſoul is now ſpiritually fit for it, and to be invited to it. In ſumme, the beſt preparation is made, the ſoul is feaſted: <hi>i. e.</hi> Divine love is <hi>ſhed abroad, Rom.</hi> 5. 5. God gives him all his favours in titles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates of them to him, according to that meaſure which is beſt for him; and ſo much (at leaſt) of Divine light is irradiated upon him, as enables him to rely upon Chriſt alone for life, and hope in his Grace. This muſt needs be a joyful day; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the day of Jubile, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:108954:173"/> joyful: Now the ſervant of ſin goes out free; he that had before bound himſelf to a ſtranger, to Satan and his luſts, is ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is his Wedding day: which is alwayes celebrated with ſymptomes of joy; more eſpecially, when a Beggar is married to a Prince; when a condemned priſoner of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is honourably eſpouſed, to the eternal Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is his Birth day; the day wherein he was new born: his Reſurrection day in which he riſeth out of his grave, <hi>verſ. 24. He was dead and is now alive.</hi> And that is a bleſſed day, <hi>Rev. 20. 6. Bleſſed is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the day of his Adoption; the day wherein the King of Glory entitles him his ſon, gives him a new Name, and ſeals up to him an irreverſible deed of conveyance, wherein he confirms him in title to an inheritance worth many Worlds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1: For Information.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here we ſee how ſincerely God ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>As I live I delight not in the death of a ſinner, but had rather he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live.</hi> The ſatisfaction which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf to take in a ſinners converſion, is an abundant confirmation of it. If after God hath ſaid and ſworn it in his Word, there
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:108954:173"/> ſhould any make a doubt of it, let him go to the converted ſinner, and he ſhall tell him ſuch a ſtory of God's abundant love, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious entertainment that he gave him, as ſhall make it evidently appear. If God did not take great delight in our Converſion, can we think that he would make ſuch a royal feaſt to entertain us, &amp; confer ſo many &amp; ſuch unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefits and bleſſings upon us? Do men uſe to kill and ſlay, to make noble feaſts for the entertainment of thoſe whom they have no delight to ſee?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we ſee a reaſon why the affections of the ſoul do often appear more ardent and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing towards God, about, or quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Converſion, than afterwards, and diſcover themſelves, both,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In an extraordinary delight in ſpiritual duties: The ſoul now can ſcarce find oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do any thing elſe, but read, hear pray, meditate, confer with Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why is it their Wedding day, it is a feaſt day with them, and they cannot but be raviſhed with it: It is a new world with a <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when come from a famine to ſuch plenty and delicacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a cotempt of the world and things of it in compariſon of theſe things; ſlighting and ſcarce regarding of any thing here below; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken with heavenly things, and deſirous,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:108954:174"/> to depart and be with Chriſt; willing to have no more to do here if might be: How can it almoſt be otherwiſe? Who can but think it good ſeeing, taſting, enjoying the love of God? and reliſhing the ſweetneſs of the ſtreams, to long to be at the Well head of all this? but when theſe treats are ſomething over, and he goe from his feaſt to his work, and there meets with difficulties, and many temptations; now he is ſometimes at a ſtand, his affections cooled with carnal things, and his heart diſtracted with worldly cares: Hence it is that we ſometimes hear God calling his people back to their firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here alſo ſee a Reaſon why Believers have uſually more raviſhments and extaſies, and abounding comforts at firſt Converſion, than afterwards: It is becauſe the robe is now brought out to them and put on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is the moſt glorious entertainment they were ever at, and they themſelves the occaſion of it; as long as this feaſt laſts it muſt needs be ſo: therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be ſure if it be thus at this time, lay in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a time of want: that may come before you think of it. Store your ſelves now with the experiences of the love expreſſions which God reveals himſelf to you in: It is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but it may be ſuch a time with you, as you ſhall never have the like opportunity while you live again.</p>

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:108954:174"/>2. And if at any time afterwards in your Chriſtian race, you meet with doubts and darkneſs, and are put to a ſtand in regard of your ſpiritual ſtate, be ſure to have recourſe to the day of eſpouſals: Call to mind the Garment, the Ring, the fatted Calf, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal. 77. 10. I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt High.</hi>

For Exhortation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto awakened Sinners in ſpecial, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and return to God; to fall down at his feet and beg his grace and favour, to confeſs your unworthineſs: Oh, long for the day of Converſion, it will be a joyful day. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will rejoyce in thee; it is well pleaſing to God, it is his delight, he takes pleaſure in the Sinners return; thou canſt not give him grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content by any thing. Thou wilt afford matter of joy to the bleſſed Angels, who are exceedingly ſatisfied in the glory of God, and Salvation of Sinners. Thou wilt glad the ſouls of glorified Saints, if not now becauſe they know it not, yet when thou ſhalt go to them, and thy preſence in that General Aſſembly of the firſt born ſhall be a witneſs to it, then will they magnifie God for it, and take pleaſure in thee. Thou ſhalt wondrouſly refreſh the ſouls of militant ſaints; thy Godly Parents, faithful Miniſters, pious neighbours, theſe ſhall have ſmiles inſtead of tears; and ſhall take delight in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:108954:175"/> reaping the fruit of their many prayers, and counſels. Thou wilt grieve none but Devils and deviliſh men.

Yet the way is more ſecret: and I verily believe they do more for the Saints than they are aware of, and may be as active in ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is good, as ſatan that which is evil: But I ſhall not adventure here to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize, therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By theſe ſervants we may underſtand the

Now Ambaſſadours are the repreſentatives of their Princes, and manage forreign affairs in their name; and theſe do diſpence for Chriſt the <hi>Goſpel of Reconciliation. verſ.</hi> 19. Hence they are called <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Stewards, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 1. Whoſe work is to diſtribute their Maſters Eſtate according to order.

                  <p n="2">2. For Confirmation of the <hi>Doctrine:</hi> The Scripture gives us clear light for this truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Allegorical direction, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8.

Though <hi>Paul</hi> be enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and awakened extraordinarily, he muſt be confirmed and comforted by a Miniſter: Though an Angel appear to comfort <hi>Cornelius</hi> and counſel him, yet his inſtruction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſpirit, muſt be under <hi>Peter</hi>'s miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:

                  <p n="1">1: Negatively; not for want of power in God; he needs not the aſſiſtance of Angels or men; he ſometimes doth without them; though to keep up and credit his appointed order, it is but ſeldom.</p>

                  <p n="2">2: To honour his ſervants: it is an honour to any creature to be uſed by God in any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his; but to be uſed in the greateſt work, that is ſo much more; this is it which ſo elevates <hi>Paul, Eph: 3: 8: To me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>USE,</hi> 1: For Information,</p>
                  <p n="1">1: See their folly who, contemning the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt, expect all their comforts and benefits to come from himſelf immediatly: They ſcorn to receive the beſt robe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the hands of Chriſt's Servants, but muſt have it from him without means, though (ſhould God grant us our deſire) it is moſt ſuitable that his Servants ſhould be helpful in it; yet it
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:108954:177"/> is a ſtrange frame in a <hi>Prodigal,</hi> that he will be limiting his Father, and telling him how he ſhall relieve him, or not at all? What? Can we not ſee the father's love in the gift, becauſe it is ſent by the hand of a Meſſenger? Well; if God's own way cannot content men, they are like to go without his bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe are likely to receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manifeſtations of Gods love to their ſoul, that are moſt careful and diligent in giving attendance to the Ordinances. In heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we ſhall derive all immediatly from Chriſt, but upon earth it is otherwiſe: Hence that promiſe, <hi>Prov. 8. 35, 36. Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, &amp;c.</hi> It is vain for men to depend upon immediate revelations; <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets they have, let them uſe them. <hi>Gods way is in his Temple. David</hi> deſires <hi>to dwell in Gods houſe, there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his beauty, Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. and declares ſuch as do ſo, to be bleſſed, becauſe <hi>they will still be praiſing him, Pſal. 84. 4. i. e.</hi> they will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes finding matter of praiſe.</p>

                     <hi>USE,</hi> For Exhortation: It may adviſe all ſuch as would receive the ſpiritual bleſſings of the Goſpel, to make uſe of the help of Chriſt's Servants, his Miniſters. Do you want help, relief, comfort? repair to them. Though it be true that God only can give it, and all means avail not without his bleſſing, yet is
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:108954:177"/> alſo true, that by them he diſpenſeth it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: Now, as the means are appointed by God, ſo he honours them with the preſence and efficacy of his ſpirit, which elſe is not to be expected, where there are ſuch advantages. Truth may be the ſame, ſpoken by a Miniſter and another, and yet it may come with more efficacy from ſuch an one, than from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not from any vertue in him, but from the grace of God, who will thus own his own appointments. Are you in trouble and want help? May you not blame your ſelves? You ſay, Alas! What can ſuch an one ſtead me? I anſwer, not at all of himſelf, but God comes where he will, and may juſtly leave you without the bleſſing, if you diſpiſe his way: Let then the meſſages of peace be welcome to you; if God ſends you comfort by his Servants, do not refuſe, but receive it.</p>

               <p>THe third part of the Parable hath been ſpoken to, and therein I have have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an account of the main matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the this diſcourſe; <hi>viz.</hi> To make
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:108954:181"/> diſcovery of the wretchedneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſinner, the riches of the grace of God in his Converſion, the nature alſo and quality of converting grace. I ſhall very briefly paſs over this fourth and laſt part; in which we have deſcribed the carriage of the elder ſon; by whom, we obſerved in the beginning, our Saviour aims at the ſcribes and Phariſees, whoſe murmuring at his familiarizing of himſelf with Publicans and ſinners, gave occaſion to this and the foregoing Parable: He is called the Elder, becauſe theſe men looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the proper heirs and inheriters of the Promiſes; took themſelves to be the only men of merit, and thought that all favour ſhewn to Publicans was miſapplyed.</p>
               <p>In this part of the Parable there are two parts. 1. The offence which this ſon took at his father's carriage to his younger brother, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. to 31. 2. The Father's vindicating the righteouſneſs and equity of the carriage, <hi>verſ,</hi> 31, 32.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the offenſe we may obſerve, 1. The ground of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The information given him of his brothers entertainment, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his ears, confuſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. and partly by information upon enquiry, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. further illuſtrated by the place where he was, when all this was done, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. 2.

I ſhall give you ſome brief hints from theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may take notice where this Elder ſon was, when all this was done, <hi>viz.</hi> in the field, about his buſineſs, following his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hard at work: Hence,</p>
               <div type="doctrine">

                  <p>The eldeſt ſon was in the field, and where could he have been better? He was getting mony, while the other was ſpending it. The Scribes &amp; Phariſees were great ſticklers in the law and outward worſhip of God: hear how he boaſts of himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11. and yet all this may be where there is no ſincerity; ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20.

                  <p n="1">1. The natural enmity of the wicked againſt the Godly, makes them to grieve at all their proſperity which they partake in; Wicked
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:108954:185"/> men <hi>are of the evil one;</hi> who, next to God himſelf, hates his Children; and as there is war betwixt Chriſt and the Devil, ſo alſo there is oppoſition betwixt their ſeed: There is a <hi>ſpirit of envy</hi> in the nature of fallen man, <hi>Jam</hi> 4. 5. It hath for its objects perſons and things: The perſons whom it moſt expreſſeth it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt are the People of God, becauſe they are not of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. And the things are, all their proſperity ſo far as they apprehend it: Sorrow and miſery is not envied, at that they can rejoyce, and ſay, <hi>Aha! ſo would we have it:</hi> But their proſperity, the ſingular favours of God, their comfort, their hopes, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed aſſurance; theſe they cannot bear, and hence they are ſpitefully enraged, and <hi>gnaſh their teeth, Pſal.</hi> 112. 8. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where this ſpirit is found ruling in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, it is a certain note of an Hypocrite. I know there is no ſin but hath its motions in a Believer, but it doth not there reign; but where it ſo doth, let a mans profeſſion be what it will, it proves it vain and diſſembling: and the reaſon is plain, becauſe it contradicts this property of a Believers grace, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce both in the glory of God, and in our neighbours good; both of which are herein ſo eminently manifeſted, that if there be any grace ſtirring, it will be raiſed by it: God moſt prizeth the glory of his grace, which that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:108954:186"/> more appears, the more vile and unworthy the ſubject hath been: And the joy of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the realeſt and beſt joy that a ſoul can have, that of glory differs from it but in degree; and he that envyes God's Glory, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good, he breakes the whole Law at once.</p>

               <p>IN the laſt place we have to conſider of the fathers vindication of the righteouſneſs and equity of his carriage to his younger ſon, in which he aſſerts three things. 1. That there was no ſuch occaſion offered of making ſuch a feaſt for him, <hi>thou art ever with me.</hi> 2.

               <p>Before I come to particular obſervations, it
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:108954:194"/> is needful to clear theſe words from an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have in this diſcourſe interpreted the elder ſon to aim firſtly at the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and ſo under them at hypocritical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, legal men, and vain boaſters; but here ſeems to be a ſcruple, <hi>viz.</hi> How comes it then that his father ſaith, <hi>All that I have is thine?</hi> Have unregenerate men a title to Gods, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al grace and favour? This objection ſeems at firſt bluſh to carry ſome force with it, and hath ſo far prevailed with ſome, as to make them interpret this eldeſt ſon to ſignifie the Godly, who (by a religious education) have not fallen into, but been kept from ſuch foul enormities; and through infirmitiy are ſometimes ſtumbled at ſuch providences of God: But then as great a ſcruple may ariſe on the other hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Shall the penitent <hi>Prodigal</hi> have no portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Is not all repaired in Chriſt, which we loſt in <hi>Adam?</hi> Was not <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had been a perſecuter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon his converſion made a juſt heir? But to come to ſome reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is certain Chriſt muſt aim at the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees in this eldeſt ſon, elſe the ſcope and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Parable had been Alien from his preſent deſigne, and ſo to no purpoſe; for his buſineſs is to ſilence their murmurings: You have the occaſion of the Parable, <hi>verſe.</hi> 1. 2. Hence the interpretation of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar muſt be ſuch, as may be reduced to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:108954:194"/> and may bear &amp; ſuit with it according to the Analogy of faith. It is a good rule in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, <hi>That all expreſſions in Parables muſt be ſo interpreted as to agree with other plain Scriptures, referring to the ſame thing.</hi> Parables are ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, in which ſpiritual things are familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to us by earthly things, by way of alluſion: Now though there be a vaſt diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Creature, between heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earthly things, yet there is ſome ſhadow of thoſe in theſe, and that is all that we ſeek in a Parable. Our Saviours deſign is to convince the Phariſees of the unreaſonableneſs of their murmurings; and he doth it by an argument <hi>â majori ad minus. q. d.</hi> The Son might ſeem to have ſome plea againſt his Father, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had none, much leſs have you againſt me: Though his ſon had been faithful, and careful, and was heir, yet his father could make a feaſt, and receive his younger ſon without detriment to the other; much more may I entertain Publicans and Sinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring you, who deſerve nothing, who are holy only in pretence. Or the argument may be by way of Conceſſion: We know the Phariſees thought well of themſelves, but ſaith our Saviour, put caſe you are the men you pretend, yet what wrong is this? Is there not room left for free grace to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal?</hi> So <hi>Tertullian</hi> gloſſeth it, <hi>Poſuit illos</hi>

                  <hi>in parabold, non quales erant, ſed quales eſſe debu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erant.</hi> Except we take this rule, we ſhall ſcarce find any Parable, but will involve us in difficulty. We muſt not think, becauſe every labourer had his penny, therefore the degrees of glory are all equal: becauſe the Maſter bid the ſervants let the tares grow till harveſt, therefore Churches are to ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt hypocrites without cenſuring of them: but this may ſuffice. I now proceed to make ſome obſervations.</p>
               <div type="doctrine">
                  <head>DOCT. 1. <hi>There is never any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpecial joy over an Hypocrite. Son thou art ever with me.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The father inſinuates that he was not wont to do things ſuperfluouſly or without occaſion: And we may ſee the evidence of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> if we conſider what is the ground of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expreſſions of joy among men. Now, though men that are given to exceſs will make occaſions of feaſting, and great ſhews of jocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, where there is no reaſon; yet as joy is an affection moved by the apprehenſion of ſome preſent good; ſo, the extraordinary ſignifying of it by feaſts, mirth, great entertainments, is when the reaſon of it is more than uſual: Hence the moſt of thoſe occaſions recorded in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:108954:195"/> Scripture are either, 1. The revolution of birth dayes, ſo <hi>Herod kept his birth day, Mat.</hi> 14. 6. and <hi>Pharach, Gen.</hi> 40. 20. 2. The time of wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Iſaak, Gen.</hi> 21. 8. 3. Marriages; Chriſt honoured with his preſence a wedding feaſt, and with his firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. begin. 4. Great victorys and deliverances, hence dayes of thankſgiving ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and hence the paſſeover. 5. Gods ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſing upon their labours, in giving them the fruit of the earth. Hence the feaſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering. 6. The entertainment of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or occaſional viſitation of friends; thus <hi>Lot</hi> made a feaſt for the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 3. and <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Abner, 2 Sam.</hi> 3. 20. 7. The finding of that which was loſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 6-9. But there is no ſuch reſpect in one or another kind, on a ſpiritual account, with an hypocrite: whereupon God ſhould make him a joyful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath no birth day; was never born again, but lives and lies in ſin: All his legal and moral duties are but <hi>ſplendida peccata:</hi> He is the ſame he was, there is no gracious change wrought in him: There is more reaſon to mourn over him as a dead man; than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over him as a living man; to celebrate his funeral, than his birth: The ſtate of nature is a ſtate of death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was never weaned from the world and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:108954:196"/> vanities of it, but ſtill hangs upon its breaſts, ſeeking his contentment among creatures, and to ſatisfie his appetite upon theſe things; <hi>His name is written in the earth,</hi> he lives upon lying vanities, cannot ſay as <hi>David, Pſal. 131. 2. I am like a weaned Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is not married to Chriſt; his league with ſin and ſatan was never broken, he was never dead to the law that he might be united to a Saviour: How ſhould there be a marriage feaſt without a marriage? Chriſt indeed hath woed him, but he never gave his conſent, nor will leave playing the harlot with other lovers; never embraced that call, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He never was a conquerour over his luſts, nor got victory upon his corruptions; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a ſlave of ſin and ſatan, led about at his pleaſure, and ſerving divers luſts: Sin rules him, his Chains were never knockt off, nor his priſon doors broken open, but he lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and condemnation of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath brought forth no fruit to God, or to his own ſouls comfort; is a dry heath and barren ground, a fig tree, which if it have the leaves of a profeſſion, yet hath no fruit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; a vine, which if it bear any grapes, they are <hi>ſower wildgrapes;</hi> a fig-tree long wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on for fruit, and ready for that ſentence, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground, Luk.</hi> 13. 7. A piece of ground <hi>that is nigh unto curſing. Heb.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="385" facs="tcp:108954:196"/>6. He never came to God for entertainment, not ſo much as like a ſtranger to ask his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and favour: much leſs as a ſon who had abſented himſelf, to ſeek his fathers pardon; but he lyeth out from him, keeps at a diſtance, <hi>will not come to Chriſt for life, Joh.</hi> 5. 40.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Though he be a loſt creature in himſelf, yet he was never found, but is loſt ſtill; he is yet in the wilderneſs, wandring upon the mountains: and whiles it is thus, what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can there be of ſpecial joy over him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1. Hence the joyes and boaſtings of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are groundleſs: Many talk of their hopes, and comforts, and ſoul ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they tell how God refreſhed them at this and that time with theſe and thoſe promiſes; nay, they have had <hi>taſtes of the powers of the world to come:</hi> Alas! enfatuated ſouls! God doth not ſcatter his joyes promiſcuouſly: Though men may, God will not make a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs feaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> 2. It may put men upon enquiry, when they cannot find that comfort and joy in their ſervice which they expect, whither this may not be the reaſon of it: I do not ſay it is alwayes ſo, the beſt Saint may ſit in the dark, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. And there are other reaſons why the al-wiſe God will make his own Children to faſt, and to mourn too: Many falls, much heedleſneſs; yea, their weakneſs to bear much
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:108954:197"/> of this new wine; God ſtints his own People, and will not kill them with Cordials: But I ſay, it is a good enquiry, haſt thou not, nor ever hadſt any taſt of theſe joyes? ask then, am I new born, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> If there be none of this, wonder not, there was no occaſion: moſt men act prepoſterouſly, they try their grace by their joyes, whereas they ought to try their joyes by their Grace.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That God in the diſpenſing of his grace, acts as a free Agent. This is inſinuated in that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 15. A Father is not bound to give an account to his Children how he improves his eſtate; much leſs is God to ſinful men how he diſtributes his grace. The Creature cannot oblige the Creator, much leſs a ſinful creature, who hath forfeited all: It is the Apoſtles Challenge, <hi>Rom. 11. 31. Who hath</hi>

                     <hi>given to him at any time?</hi> There cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons <hi>in gratuitis;</hi> there is no bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule of juſtice in the beſtowing of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and where the benefit is a free favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the chuſing one, and paſſing by another is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and depends on the will of the Doner. In Gods beſtowing of Grace on the Children of men, there can be none worthy, and if he will pitch upon the moſt unworthy, to make his favour the more notable, who ſhall call him to an account?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the beſt works of the moſt refined hypocrites are no ways obliging or deſerving. An unregenerate man may do many things materially good, he may pray, confeſs his ſins, read the word, attend upon ordinances, carry fair among men, abſtain from many evils, do many duties; but ſtill they deſerve no favour, nay, they deſerve the wrath of God; <hi>Their prayer is abomination, their plowing ſin,</hi> their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations deteſtable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. begin. If the Godly do confeſs their beſt to be rags, their holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties dung; what then muſt we ſay of what the unregenerate do, who have no ſaving princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holineſs, no meadiatour through whom to obtain acceptance, no good end in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the ſame grace is tendered to them, and the ſame means of obtaining it are afforded them; if therefore they go without it, it is
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:108954:198"/> their own fault. Men are indeed ready to ſay, <hi>God's wayes are unequal,</hi> when their own wayes are ſo: The proffer of Grace in the Goſpel is univerſal; if men thirſt, God ſhews them the waters, and bids them come freely; if they thirſt not, and will not come, who is to blame? <hi>God ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long, but they gain ſay:</hi> God ſaith, If they will repent and believe they ſhall be ſaved; but they ſay, <hi>Theſe many years have I ſerved thee, neither at any time tranſgreſſed I thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> God ſaith, if you be ſick, here is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, they ſay we are well and need him not. And what wrong then is it to them, if when a company of ſick ſouls, who feel their malady, and are ready to dy of it, come to him for healing, he ſhows his skill; if when a company of hunger-ſtarved beggars come to him for food, he feeds them; yea, plentifully feaſts them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> Learn we hence in ſtead of quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, to admire the free grace of God, which opens a door of hope to the greateſt and worſt of ſinners: Do not diſcourage or daſh the hopes of any; be not afraid to invite the worſt to come to Chriſt upon Goſpel-terms; nor let any poor ſoul that is ſtung with ſin, that ſees it ly as mountains between him and God, deſpair of Salvation: Lo, Chriſt came <hi>skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over the mountains, and leaping over the hills:</hi>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:108954:198"/> Say not, can God ſave me and be juſt? He hath ſatisfied his own Juſtice, and will ſilence the cavils of Men and Devils: Say not there is no hope for me; think therefore of the <hi>Prodigal:</hi> Are there ſuch bowels in men? and are not God's thoughts above ours? This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was written for thy ſake, who haſt been a chief ſinner, and now art humbled, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thee to go to God in the name of Chriſt, and to hope for his mercy.</p>

I know you will plead, it is lawful to be cheerful, &amp; that civilly in the enjoyment of the outward comforts of this life: True, but when? when they are ſanctified by the grace of God, and made yours in the New-Covenant: Get this title, and then you may rejoyce in all Gods goodneſs; till then take this bitter pill; all the curſes written in the book of God are upon you, and all the things that you rejoyce in are tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them; you are going to the pit, and
